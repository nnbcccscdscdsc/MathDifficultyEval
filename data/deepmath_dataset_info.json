      "r1_solution_1": "Okay, so I have this limit to evaluate: the limit as x approaches infinity of the square root of x times the difference between the cube root of (x plus 1) and the cube root of (x minus 1). Hmm, let me write that down again to make sure I have it right.\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\sqrt{x} \\left( \\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\sqrt[3]{x-1} \\right)\n\\]\n\nAlright, so it's the product of sqrt(x) and the difference of two cube roots. Since x is going to infinity, both x+1 and x-1 are going to be very close to x when x is large. But their cube roots might differ by a small amount, and multiplying by sqrt(x) could amplify that difference. The question is whether this product approaches a finite limit, zero, or infinity.\n\nI remember that when dealing with limits involving roots, especially differences of roots, expanding them using binomial approximations or using the conjugate can be helpful. But cube roots are a bit trickier than square roots. Let me think.\n\nFor square roots, we often multiply by the conjugate to rationalize. For cube roots, maybe we can use the formula for a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2). So if I let a = cube root of (x+1) and b = cube root of (x-1), then a^3 - b^3 = (x+1) - (x-1) = 2. Therefore, a - b = 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2). So maybe I can express the difference of the cube roots as 2 divided by the sum of their squares and their product. Then multiply by sqrt(x). Let's try that.\n\nLet me set a = (x + 1)^{1/3} and b = (x - 1)^{1/3}. Then, as I said, a - b = 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2). Therefore, the original expression becomes sqrt(x) * 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2). So:\n\nsqrt(x) * 2 / [ ( (x + 1)^{2/3} + (x + 1)^{1/3}(x - 1)^{1/3} + (x - 1)^{2/3} ) ]\n\nHmm, okay. So the denominator is a sum of three terms. Each of these terms is something raised to the 2/3 power or the product of two terms raised to the 1/3 power. Maybe I can factor out x from each term in the cube roots?\n\nLet's try to approximate these terms for large x. Since x is approaching infinity, x + 1 ≈ x and x - 1 ≈ x. So maybe I can write (x + 1)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} and similarly for (x - 1)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3}. Then, using the binomial approximation for (1 + ε)^k ≈ 1 + kε when ε is small.\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nFirst, (x + 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 + (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... )\n\nSimilarly, (x - 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 - (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... )\n\nTherefore, their difference, (x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}[ (1 + 1/(3x)) - (1 - 1/(3x)) ] = x^{1/3}(2/(3x)) = 2/(3x^{2/3})\n\nWait, but the original expression is sqrt(x) times this difference. So sqrt(x) times 2/(3x^{2/3}) = 2/(3x^{2/3 - 1/2}) = 2/(3x^{1/6}) ) → 0 as x → ∞. But that would imply the limit is zero. But is that right?\n\nWait, but maybe the approximation is too crude? Because the higher-order terms might contribute when multiplied by sqrt(x). Let's check this again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to be more precise with the expansion. Let me denote t = 1/x, so as x → ∞, t → 0. Then, (x + 1)^{1/3} = (x(1 + t))^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 + t)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + ... )\n\nSimilarly, (x - 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ x^{1/3}(1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + ... )\n\nSubtracting these two, we get:\n\nx^{1/3}[ (1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2) - (1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2) ) ] = x^{1/3}[ (2/3)t - (2/9)t^2 + ... ] = x^{1/3}[ (2/3)(1/x) - (2/9)(1/x^2) + ... ]\n\nSo the difference (x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} ≈ (2/3)x^{-2/3} - (2/9)x^{-5/3} + ...\n\nMultiplying this by sqrt(x) = x^{1/2}:\n\nsqrt(x) * [ (2/3)x^{-2/3} - (2/9)x^{-5/3} + ... ] = (2/3)x^{1/2 - 2/3} - (2/9)x^{1/2 - 5/3} + ... = (2/3)x^{-1/6} - (2/9)x^{-7/6} + ...\n\nAs x approaches infinity, x^{-1/6} approaches 0 and x^{-7/6} approaches 0 even faster. Therefore, the entire expression tends to 0. So according to this approximation, the limit is zero. But wait, I recall that sometimes when you have differences of roots multiplied by a certain power, the limit can be a finite number. Maybe my approximation is missing something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the expansion with more terms? Let me check.\n\nWait, but perhaps instead of expanding each cube root separately, I should apply the mean value theorem. For a function f(t) = t^{1/3}, the difference f(x+1) - f(x-1) can be approximated by f'(c)(2), where c is between x - 1 and x + 1. Then, by the mean value theorem, there exists c in (x - 1, x + 1) such that:\n\nf(x + 1) - f(x - 1) = f'(c) * 2\n\nSo f'(c) = (1/3)c^{-2/3}\n\nTherefore, the difference is 2/(3c^{2/3})\n\nThen, the original expression is sqrt(x) * 2/(3c^{2/3})\n\nSince c is between x - 1 and x + 1, as x approaches infinity, c is approximately x. Therefore, c^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3}\n\nTherefore, sqrt(x) * 2/(3x^{2/3}) = (2/3) x^{1/2 - 2/3} = (2/3) x^{-1/6} → 0 as x → ∞\n\nSo this also suggests the limit is zero.\n\nBut maybe there's a mistake here? Because sometimes when using approximations, if the higher order terms are significant when multiplied by another term, but in this case, both methods give zero. Maybe the limit is indeed zero. But let's try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity for a^3 - b^3 as I initially thought.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nsqrt(x) * (a - b) = sqrt(x) * ( (a^3 - b^3) / (a^2 + ab + b^2) ) = sqrt(x) * 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2)\n\nSince a = (x + 1)^{1/3}, b = (x - 1)^{1/3}\n\nSo, a^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(1 + 2/(3x)), b^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - 2/(3x)), and ab ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - 1/(3x^2)) ?\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst, a^2 = (x + 1)^{2/3} = x^{2/3}(1 + 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3}(1 + (2/3)(1/x) - (2/9)(1/x^2) + ... )\n\nSimilarly, b^2 = (x - 1)^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - (2/3)(1/x) - (2/9)(1/x^2) + ... )\n\nab = (x + 1)^{1/3}(x - 1)^{1/3} = [ (x + 1)(x - 1) ]^{1/3} = (x^2 - 1)^{1/3} = x^{2/3}(1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - (1/3)(1/x^2) + ... )\n\nTherefore, the denominator a^2 + ab + b^2 ≈ x^{2/3}[ (1 + 2/(3x) - 2/(9x^2)) + (1 - 2/(3x) - 2/(9x^2)) + (1 - 1/(3x^2)) ]\n\nWait, let's compute term by term:\n\na^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(1 + (2/(3x)) - (2/(9x^2)))\n\nb^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - (2/(3x)) - (2/(9x^2)))\n\nab ≈ x^{2/3}(1 - (1/(3x^2)))\n\nAdding these together:\n\na^2 + ab + b^2 ≈ x^{2/3}[ (1 + 2/(3x) - 2/(9x^2)) + (1 - 2/(3x) - 2/(9x^2)) + (1 - 1/(3x^2)) ]\n\nCombine the constants:\n\n1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nThe terms with 1/x:\n\n(2/(3x) - 2/(3x)) = 0\n\nThe terms with 1/x^2:\n\n-2/(9x^2) -2/(9x^2) -1/(3x^2) = (-4/9 - 3/9)/x^2 = (-7/9)/x^2\n\nTherefore, overall:\n\na^2 + ab + b^2 ≈ x^{2/3}(3 - 7/(9x^2))\n\nSo, the denominator is approximately 3x^{2/3}, and the correction term is negligible as x approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, the original expression is sqrt(x) * 2 / (3x^{2/3}) = (2/3) x^{1/2 - 2/3} = (2/3) x^{-1/6} → 0 as x → ∞\n\nHmm, so all three methods: binomial expansion, mean value theorem, and the a^3 - b^3 identity lead to the conclusion that the limit is zero. So maybe the answer is zero.\n\nBut wait, maybe there is an error here. Let me check with concrete numbers. Let me plug in a very large x, say x = 10^6, and compute the value numerically.\n\nCompute sqrt(10^6) * ( (10^6 +1)^{1/3} - (10^6 -1)^{1/3} )\n\nsqrt(10^6) = 1000.\n\nNow, (10^6 +1)^{1/3} ≈ 100^{2} * (1 + 1/(10^6))^{1/3} ≈ 100^2 * (1 + 1/(3*10^6)) = 10000 + 10000/(3*10^6) ≈ 10000 + 0.003333...\n\nSimilarly, (10^6 -1)^{1/3} ≈ 100^2 * (1 - 1/(10^6))^{1/3} ≈ 10000 - 10000/(3*10^6) ≈ 10000 - 0.003333...\n\nSo their difference is approximately 0.006666...\n\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = 1000: 0.006666... * 1000 ≈ 6.666...\n\nWait, that's around 6.666, which is 20/3 ≈ 6.666... So this contradicts the previous analytical results that suggested the limit is zero. But when I plug in x = 10^6, the value is approximately 20/3. That's unexpected. Therefore, my previous analytical approach must be flawed.\n\nWait, what? So according to numerical evaluation, when x is 10^6, the expression is about 6.666, which is 20/3, but when x approaches infinity, is this approaching a finite limit or going to infinity?\n\nWait, but x=10^6 is large, but maybe the limit is a finite number, not zero. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, my mistake in numerical calculation. Wait, hold on. Let me redo the numerical example more carefully.\n\nWait, x = 10^6, so x +1 = 1000001, x -1 = 999999.\n\nCompute cube roots:\n\nFirst, (10^6)^{1/3} = 100, because (100)^3 = 1,000,000. So 10^6 is (100)^3.\n\nTherefore, (10^6 +1)^{1/3} is slightly more than 100, and (10^6 -1)^{1/3} is slightly less than 100.\n\nLet me compute the difference:\n\nLet me use the binomial approximation for (100^3 + 1)^{1/3} = 100*(1 + 1/100^3)^{1/3} ≈ 100*(1 + 1/(3*100^3)) = 100 + 1/(3*100^2) = 100 + 1/30000 ≈ 100.0000333333\n\nSimilarly, (100^3 -1)^{1/3} ≈ 100*(1 - 1/100^3)^{1/3} ≈ 100*(1 - 1/(3*100^3)) = 100 - 1/(3*100^3) = 100 - 1/3000000 ≈ 99.9999996667\n\nTherefore, the difference between the two cube roots is approximately 100.0000333333 - 99.9999996667 ≈ 0.0000336666\n\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = sqrt(10^6) = 1000:\n\n0.0000336666 * 1000 ≈ 0.0336666\n\nWhich is approximately 0.0337, which is roughly 1/30, which is approximately 0.0333. So in reality, the numerical value is about 0.0337, not 6.666. So my previous calculation was wrong because I miscalculated the cube roots.\n\nWait, so 10^6 is (100)^3, so cube root of 10^6 is 100. Then, adding or subtracting 1 would change the cube root by a tiny amount, as shown. So the difference is approximately 0.0000333333, and multiplied by 1000 gives approximately 0.0333, which is 1/30. Wait, 1/30 is approximately 0.0333. So then, this suggests that the limit might be 2/3 / 2? Wait, but 0.0333 is 1/30, which is approximately 0.0333. Wait, but 2/3 divided by 10 is 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.0666. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the limit is 2/(3*2) = 1/3. Hmm, but 0.0333 is 1/30. So perhaps my numerical evaluation is conflicting with analytical?\n\nWait, maybe my analytical approach was wrong. Let me re-examine the steps.\n\nSo, earlier, using the binomial expansion, I approximated (x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} ≈ 2/(3x^{2/3}) - 2/(9x^{5/3}) + ... Then multiplied by sqrt(x) gives (2/3)x^{-1/6} - (2/9)x^{-7/6} + ..., which tends to zero. But the numerical example with x = 10^6 gave approximately 0.0333, which is 1/30, which is x^{-1/6} evaluated at x=10^6: (10^6)^{-1/6} = 10^{-1} = 0.1, then 2/3 * 0.1 ≈ 0.0666, but my numerical calculation gave 0.0333. So there is a discrepancy.\n\nWait, that suggests that the next term is subtracting something. Let's compute the exact difference.\n\nLet me compute the exact difference for x=10^6.\n\nCompute (10^6 +1)^{1/3} - (10^6 -1)^{1/3}.\n\nLet me use the identity a - b = (a^3 - b^3)/(a^2 + ab + b^2)\n\nHere, a = (10^6 +1)^{1/3}, b = (10^6 -1)^{1/3}\n\nThen, a^3 - b^3 = (10^6 +1) - (10^6 -1) = 2\n\nThe denominator is a^2 + ab + b^2. Since a and b are both approximately 100, a ≈ 100 + δ, b ≈ 100 - δ, where δ is small.\n\nCompute a^2 + ab + b^2 ≈ (100 + δ)^2 + (100 + δ)(100 - δ) + (100 - δ)^2\n\nExpand:\n\n(100^2 + 200δ + δ^2) + (100^2 - δ^2) + (100^2 - 200δ + δ^2)\n\n= 100^2 + 200δ + δ^2 + 100^2 - δ^2 + 100^2 - 200δ + δ^2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3*100^2 + (200δ - 200δ) + (δ^2 - δ^2 + δ^2)\n\n= 3*10000 + δ^2\n\n= 30000 + δ^2\n\nSince δ is very small, δ ≈ (a - 100) ≈ derivative of x^{1/3} at x=10^6 times 1. The derivative is (1/3)x^{-2/3}, so δ ≈ (1/3)*(10^6)^{-2/3} = (1/3)*(100)^{-4/3} = (1/3)*(100^{-1}) )? Wait, (10^6)^{2/3} = (10^6)^{2/3} = 10^{4} = 10000. So derivative is (1/3)*10^{-4} = 1/30000. So δ ≈ 1/(3*10^4) = 0.000033333...\n\nTherefore, δ^2 ≈ (1/9)*10^{-8} = negligible.\n\nTherefore, denominator ≈ 30000\n\nTherefore, a - b ≈ 2 / 30000 = 1 / 15000 ≈ 0.000066666...\n\nBut wait, in reality, when we compute a - b numerically, we found approximately 0.000033333... Wait, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Wait, in reality, the cube roots of 10^6 +1 and 10^6 -1 are 100.000033333... and 99.999966666..., so their difference is 0.000066666..., which is 2/(3*10^4) = 2/30000 = 1/15000 ≈ 0.000066666...\n\nBut when I multiplied by sqrt(x) = 1000, that gives 1000 * 0.000066666... ≈ 0.066666..., which is 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.066666...\n\nBut earlier, my numerical approximation said 0.0333, but that was incorrect. Wait, maybe my first numerical calculation was wrong.\n\nWait, let me compute (10^6 +1)^{1/3} and (10^6 -1)^{1/3} more accurately.\n\nFirst, (10^6)^{1/3} = 100. Let's compute 100^3 = 1,000,000.\n\nCompute (100 + Δ)^3 = 1,000,000 +1. Let me solve for Δ:\n\n(100 + Δ)^3 = 100^3 + 3*100^2*Δ + 3*100*Δ^2 + Δ^3 = 1,000,000 + 30,000Δ + 300Δ^2 + Δ^3 = 1,000,001.\n\nTherefore, 30,000Δ + 300Δ^2 + Δ^3 = 1.\n\nAssuming Δ is very small, the Δ^2 and Δ^3 terms are negligible, so 30,000Δ ≈ 1 → Δ ≈ 1/30,000 ≈ 0.000033333...\n\nTherefore, (10^6 +1)^{1/3} ≈ 100 + 1/30,000\n\nSimilarly, (10^6 -1)^{1/3} ≈ 100 - 1/30,000\n\nTherefore, the difference is (100 + 1/30,000) - (100 - 1/30,000) = 2/30,000 = 1/15,000 ≈ 0.000066666...\n\nMultiply by sqrt(10^6) = 1000: 1/15,000 * 1000 = 1000/15,000 = 1/15 ≈ 0.066666...\n\nSo the correct numerical value is approximately 0.0666..., which is 2/30 = 1/15. Wait, but according to the analytical result earlier, the leading term was (2/3) x^{-1/6}. For x = 10^6, x^{-1/6} = (10^6)^{-1/6} = 10^{-1} = 0.1, so (2/3)*0.1 ≈ 0.066666..., which matches the numerical result. Then, according to the expansion, the next term is -(2/9)x^{-7/6}, which for x=10^6 is -(2/9)*(10^6)^{-7/6} = -(2/9)*10^{-7} ≈ -0.0000000222..., which is negligible. Therefore, the leading term is indeed 0.0666..., which is 2/3 * 0.1 = 0.0666...\n\nTherefore, this suggests that as x increases, the expression approaches zero, because x^{-1/6} tends to zero. However, when x = 10^6, the value is still 0.0666..., which is 1/15, and for larger x, it would be smaller. For example, x = 10^{12}, x^{-1/6} = 10^{-2} = 0.01, so (2/3)*0.01 ≈ 0.006666..., which is 1/150. So as x increases, the expression tends to zero. Therefore, the limit is zero.\n\nBut wait, then why does the numerical example with x=10^6 give 0.0666, which is non-zero? Because x^{-1/6} approaches zero, but very slowly. For example, to get x^{-1/6} = 0.01, you need x = 10^6. To get x^{-1/6} = 0.001, you need x = 10^{18}, which is extremely large. So even though the limit is zero, for practical purposes, even at x=10^6, the value is still around 0.0666.\n\nBut mathematically, as x approaches infinity, x^{-1/6} approaches zero, so the limit is zero.\n\nBut now I'm confused because my initial expansion suggested that the difference (x +1)^{1/3} - (x -1)^{1/3} is approximately 2/(3x^{2/3}), and multiplying by sqrt(x) gives 2/(3x^{1/6}), which tends to zero. But let me check with another example. Suppose x approaches infinity, then x^{1/6} also approaches infinity, so 1/x^{1/6} approaches zero.\n\nWait, yes. For example, x^{1/6} is the sixth root of x. So as x becomes larger, x^{1/6} increases, so 1/x^{1/6} decreases to zero. Therefore, the expression 2/(3x^{1/6}) tends to zero. Therefore, the limit should be zero.\n\nBut the numerical evaluation shows that even at x = 10^6, which is large, the value is 0.0666, which is 2/(3*10^{1/6})?\n\nWait, no. Wait, x = 10^6, so x^{1/6} = (10^6)^{1/6} = 10^{1} = 10. So 2/(3*10) = 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.0666..., which matches the numerical result. Therefore, the general term is 2/(3x^{1/6}), which tends to zero as x approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, the limit is zero. Therefore, both analytical approaches and numerical evaluation confirm that, although the expression approaches zero very slowly (since x^{-1/6} decays slowly), it still approaches zero.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be zero.\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps when expanding the cube roots, I should have considered higher-order terms?\n\nWait, let's use a more accurate expansion.\n\nLet me write (x + 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}[1 + (1/(3x)) - (1/(9x^2)) + (5/(81x^3)) - ... ] using the binomial expansion up to the third term.\n\nSimilarly, (x - 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}[1 - (1/(3x)) - (1/(9x^2)) - (5/(81x^3)) - ... ]\n\nSubtracting these two:\n\n(x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} = x^{1/3}[ (2/(3x)) - (10/(81x^3)) + ... ] = (2/(3x^{2/3})) - (10/(81x^{8/3)) + ...\n\nMultiplying by sqrt(x) = x^{1/2}:\n\nx^{1/2}*(2/(3x^{2/3})) - x^{1/2}*(10/(81x^{8/3)) ) = (2/3)x^{-1/6} - (10/81)x^{-13/6} + ...\n\nSo as x approaches infinity, the first term tends to zero, and the second term tends to zero even faster. So indeed, the limit is zero.\n\nAlternatively, using the expansion up to the second term:\n\nThe difference is approximately (2/(3x^{2/3})) - (2/(9x^{5/3})). Multiplying by x^{1/2}:\n\n(2/3)x^{-1/6} - (2/9)x^{-7/6}, both terms go to zero.\n\nTherefore, all expansions confirm that the limit is zero.\n\nBut wait, another approach: let me set t = 1/x, so as x → ∞, t → 0. Then rewrite the expression in terms of t.\n\nLet x = 1/t, so t → 0+.\n\nThe expression becomes sqrt(1/t) * [ ( (1/t + 1)^{1/3} - (1/t - 1)^{1/3} ) ] = (1/sqrt(t)) [ ( ( (1 + t)/t )^{1/3} - ( (1 - t)/t )^{1/3} ) ]\n\nSimplify inside the cube roots:\n\n( (1 + t)/t )^{1/3} = (1/t + 1)^{1/3} = (1/t)^{1/3}(1 + t)^{1/3} = t^{-1/3}(1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + ... )\n\nSimilarly, ( (1 - t)/t )^{1/3} = t^{-1/3}(1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 - ... )\n\nSubtracting:\n\nt^{-1/3}[ (1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2) - (1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2) ) ] = t^{-1/3}[ (2/3)t - (2/9)t^2 + ... ] = (2/3)t^{2/3} - (2/9)t^{5/3} + ...\n\nMultiply by (1/sqrt(t)) = t^{-1/2}:\n\n(2/3)t^{2/3 - 1/2} - (2/9)t^{5/3 - 1/2} + ... = (2/3)t^{1/6} - (2/9)t^{7/6} + ...\n\nAs t → 0+, t^{1/6} → 0, so the entire expression tends to zero.\n\nThus, regardless of the approach, the limit is zero.\n\nBut the numerical example with x=10^6 gave approximately 0.0666, which is 2/3 * x^{-1/6} = 2/3 * (10^6)^{-1/6} = 2/3 * 10^{-1} = 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.0666. So for finite x, even very large, the value is non-zero, but as x grows without bound, it tends to zero.\n\nTherefore, the limit is zero.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the numerical calculation earlier where I thought the value was 1/30. No, in reality, when corrected, it's 1/15, which aligns with the analytical result.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration and multiple approaches, I conclude that the limit is zero.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0}\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\sqrt{x} \\left( \\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\sqrt[3]{x-1} \\right)\\), we can use several approaches including binomial expansion, the mean value theorem, and algebraic manipulation.\n\n1. **Binomial Expansion**:\n   - Approximate \\((x + 1)^{1/3}\\) and \\((x - 1)^{1/3}\\) using binomial expansion for large \\(x\\):\n     \\[\n     (x + 1)^{1/3} \\approx x^{1/3} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{3x} - \\frac{1}{9x^2} + \\cdots \\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     (x - 1)^{1/3} \\approx x^{1/3} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3x} - \\frac{1}{9x^2} + \\cdots \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Subtract the expansions:\n     \\[\n     (x + 1)^{1/3} - (x - 1)^{1/3} \\approx x^{1/3} \\left( \\frac{2}{3x} - \\frac{2}{9x^2} + \\cdots \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} x^{-2/3} - \\frac{2}{9} x^{-5/3} + \\cdots\n     \\]\n   - Multiply by \\(\\sqrt{x}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{x} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} x^{-2/3} - \\frac{2}{9} x^{-5/3} + \\cdots \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} x^{-1/6} - \\frac{2}{9} x^{-7/6} + \\cdots\n     \\]\n   - As \\(x \\to \\infty\\), the terms \\(x^{-1/6}\\) and \\(x^{-7/6}\\) approach zero.\n\n2. **Mean Value Theorem**:\n   - Let \\(f(t) = t^{1/3}\\).

Thus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]",
      "r1_solution_2": "Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as x approaches infinity of sqrt(x) times (the cube root of (x+1) minus the cube root of (x-1)).

So the expression is sqrt(x) multiplied by the difference of two cube roots. Both cube roots are of expressions that are close to x when x is large. So maybe I can approximate the difference between the cube roots?\n\nFirst, let me recall that for large x, (x + 1) and (x - 1) are both approximately x. But their cube roots will be approximately cube root of x. However, there's a small difference between them, and when multiplied by sqrt(x), which is also growing, the limit might not be zero. So I need to find a way to expand the cube roots to get a better approximation of their difference.\n\nOne technique I remember for dealing with differences of roots is to use the identity a^n - b^n = (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + ... + b^{n-1}). But in this case, we have cube roots, so maybe I can write the difference as (x+1)^{1/3} - (x-1)^{1/3} and then factor out x^{1/3} from both terms?\n\nLet me try that. Let's factor x^{1/3} from each cube root:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{x+1} = \\sqrt[3]{x \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)} = x^{1/3} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt[3]{x-1} = \\sqrt[3]{x \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)} = x^{1/3} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1/3}\n\\]\n\nSo the difference becomes:\n\n\\[\nx^{1/3} \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1/3} - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1/3} \\right]\n\\]\n\nThen, the original expression is sqrt(x) times this, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x} \\cdot x^{1/3} \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1/3} - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1/3} \\right] = x^{1/2 + 1/3} \\left[ \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1/3} - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1/3} \\right]\n\\]\n\nAdding the exponents: 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6. So that's x^{5/6} times the difference in brackets.\n\nNow, I need to approximate the term in brackets. For small h, (1 + h)^{1/3} can be expanded using the Taylor series or binomial approximation. Since 1/x is small when x is large, I can use the expansion:\n\n(1 + h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + ... and similarly for (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + ...\n\nWait, let me check that. The binomial expansion for (1 + h)^k around h=0 is 1 + kh + (k(k - 1)/2)h² + ..., so for k = 1/3:\n\n(1 + h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + (5/81)h³ - ... and so on.\n\nSimilarly, (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h² - (5/81)h³ - ...\n\nTherefore, subtracting these two expansions:\n\n(1 + h)^{1/3} - (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ [1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h²] - [1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h²] = (1/3)h - (1/9)h² - (-1/3)h - (-1/9)h²) Wait, let me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSecond term: (1/3)h - (-1/3)h = (2/3)h\n\nThird term: - (1/9)h² - ( -1/9)h² = 0\n\nFourth term: (5/81)h³ - (-5/81)h³ = (10/81)h³\n\nBut since h is 1/x, which is very small, maybe up to the h term is sufficient? Let's see.\n\nWait, if h = 1/x, then h² = 1/x², which is much smaller than h. So if we approximate up to h, then the difference is (2/3)h. But is that enough? Let's check.\n\nIf we take the expansion up to h, then (1 + h)^{1/3} - (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ (2/3)h. However, we are multiplying this difference by x^{5/6}. Let's see:\n\nOriginal expression: x^{5/6} * [ (2/3)h + higher order terms ]\n\nBut h = 1/x, so substituting h:\n\nx^{5/6} * [ (2/3)(1/x) + ... ] = (2/3) x^{5/6 - 1} + ... = (2/3) x^{-1/6} + ... which tends to 0 as x approaches infinity. But this contradicts my initial thought that the limit might not be zero. Hmm, but maybe the first term cancels out, and the next term is needed?\n\nWait, maybe I need to go to the next term in the expansion. Let's try expanding up to h³.\n\nSo, as per earlier, (1 + h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + (5/81)h³\n\nSimilarly, (1 - h)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h² - (5/81)h³\n\nSubtracting them:\n\n[1 + (1/3)h - (1/9)h² + (5/81)h³] - [1 - (1/3)h - (1/9)h² - (5/81)h³]\n\n= (1 - 1) + [(1/3)h + (1/3)h] + [(-1/9)h² + (1/9)h²] + [(5/81)h³ + (5/81)h³]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (2/3)h + 0 + (10/81)h³\n\nTherefore, the difference is (2/3)h + (10/81)h³ + higher order terms.\n\nSo plugging h = 1/x, we get:\n\n(2/3)(1/x) + (10/81)(1/x³) + ...\n\nThen, multiplying by x^{5/6}:\n\nx^{5/6} * [ (2/3)x^{-1} + (10/81)x^{-3} + ... ] = (2/3) x^{5/6 - 1} + (10/81) x^{5/6 - 3} + ... = (2/3) x^{-1/6} + (10/81) x^{-13/6} + ...\n\nAs x approaches infinity, x^{-1/6} approaches 0, and the other terms are even smaller. So according to this, the limit would be 0. But I need to check if this is accurate.\n\nWait, maybe there's a mistake in the expansion. Let me double-check the coefficients. The binomial expansion for (1 + h)^k is:\n\n1 + kh + \\frac{k(k - 1)}{2} h² + \\frac{k(k - 1)(k - 2)}{6} h³ + ...\n\nSo for k = 1/3:\n\nFirst term: 1\n\nSecond term: (1/3)h\n\nThird term: (1/3)(1/3 - 1)/2 h² = (1/3)(-2/3)/2 h² = (-1/9)h²\n\nFourth term: (1/3)(-2/3)(-5/3)/6 h³ = (1/3)(-2/3)(-5/3)/6 = (10/81)h³\n\nSo yes, that's correct. So up to h³, the expansion is correct.\n\nTherefore, the difference is (2/3)h + (10/81)h³ + ... So when h = 1/x, substituting:\n\n(2/3)(1/x) + (10/81)(1/x³) + ...\n\nTherefore, multiplying by x^{5/6} gives:\n\n(2/3) x^{-1/6} + (10/81) x^{-13/6} + ... which goes to 0 as x approaches infinity.\n\nWait, but that suggests the limit is 0. Is that correct? Let me try to plug in some large x to test.\n\nSuppose x is 1,000,000. Then sqrt(x) is 1000. The cube roots:\n\nCube root of 1,000,001 vs cube root of 999,999.\n\nCube root of 1,000,000 is 100. Then, the cube root of 1,000,001 is approximately 100 + (1)/(3*100²) = 100 + 1/(30,000) ≈ 100.000033333. Similarly, cube root of 999,999 is approximately 100 - 1/(3*100²) ≈ 99.999966666. The difference between them is approximately 0.000066666. Multiply by sqrt(x) = 1000: 0.000066666 * 1000 ≈ 0.066666..., which is about 2/30 ≈ 1/15 ≈ 0.0667. But as x increases, what happens?\n\nWait, when x is 1,000,000, we get approx 0.0667, but if x increases further, say x = 10^12, then sqrt(x) is 10^6, and the difference in cube roots would be approx (2)/(3x^{2/3}) because derivative of x^{1/3} is (1/3)x^{-2/3}, so difference approx 2*(1/(3x^{2/3})). Then sqrt(x)*difference is sqrt(x)*(2/(3x^{2/3})) = 2/(3x^{2/3 - 1/2}) = 2/(3x^{1/6}). So as x increases, this expression tends to 0. So for x=10^12, x^{1/6}=10^2=100, so 2/(3*100)=1/150≈0.006666..., which is smaller. So indeed, as x increases, the expression tends to 0. So maybe the limit is 0.\n\nBut wait, when I plug in x=1,000,000, I get around 0.0666, and when x=10^12, it's 0.00666, so it's approaching 0. Hence, perhaps the limit is indeed 0. But let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the mean value theorem. For a function f(t) = t^{1/3}, the difference f(x+1) - f(x-1) can be written as f'(c)(2), where c is between x-1 and x+1. By the mean value theorem, there exists c in (x-1, x+1) such that:\n\nf(x+1) - f(x-1) = f'(c)*(2)\n\nSo f'(c) = (1/3)c^{-2/3}\n\nTherefore, the difference is (2/3)c^{-2/3}\n\nSo substituting back into the original expression:\n\nsqrt(x)*(2/(3c^{2/3}))\n\nSince c is between x-1 and x+1, as x approaches infinity, c is approximately x. Therefore, c^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3}\n\nTherefore, sqrt(x)/(x^{2/3}) = x^{1/2 - 2/3} = x^{-1/6} which approaches 0 as x approaches infinity. Hence, the limit is 0.\n\nBut wait, but when I computed with x=1,000,000, I had approx 0.0666, which is 2/(3*100) = 2/300 ≈ 0.006666, but wait, no. Wait, x=1,000,000, c≈x, so c^{2/3} = (10^6)^{2/3}=10^{4}=10,000. So sqrt(x) is 1000. So sqrt(x)/c^{2/3}=1000/10,000=1/10. Then multiplied by 2/3: 2/3*1/10≈0.0666. Which matches the earlier approximation. So for x=1,000,000, it's 0.0666, but as x increases, sqrt(x)/c^{2/3}=x^{1/2}/x^{2/3}=x^{-1/6}, which is x^{-1/6}. Therefore, as x approaches infinity, this term approaches 0. So indeed, the limit should be 0.\n\nBut I need to check if there is a miscalculation here. Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me set t = 1/x, so as x approaches infinity, t approaches 0. Then rewrite the expression in terms of t.\n\nLet x = 1/t, so when x approaches infinity, t approaches 0 from the positive side.\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\nsqrt(1/t) [ ( (1/t + 1)^{1/3} - (1/t - 1)^{1/3} ) ]\n\nBut wait, (1/t + 1) = (1 + t)/t, and (1/t - 1) = (1 - t)/t. Wait, no:\n\nWait, x = 1/t, so x + 1 = 1/t + 1 = (1 + t)/t, and x -1 = 1/t -1 = (1 - t)/t.\n\nTherefore, cube roots become:\n\n[(1 + t)/t]^{1/3} - [(1 - t)/t]^{1/3} = t^{-1/3} [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ]\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is:\n\nsqrt(1/t) * t^{-1/3} [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ]\n\nsqrt(1/t) is t^{-1/2}, so multiplied by t^{-1/3} gives t^{-1/2 -1/3} = t^{-5/6}\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\nt^{-5/6} [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ]\n\nNow, expand (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} using the binomial expansion for small t:\n\nAs before, (1 + t)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t² + (5/81)t³ - ...\n\n(1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t² - (5/81)t³ + ...\n\nSubtracting them:\n\n[1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t² + ...] - [1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t² - ...] = (2/3)t + (10/81)t³ + ...\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\nt^{-5/6} [ (2/3)t + (10/81)t³ + ... ] = (2/3) t^{1 - 5/6} + (10/81) t^{3 -5/6} + ... = (2/3) t^{1/6} + (10/81) t^{13/6} + ...\n\nAs t approaches 0, t^{1/6} approaches 0, and the other terms also approach 0. Therefore, the limit is 0.\n\nHmm. So all these methods seem to indicate that the limit is 0. But when I plug in x=1,000,000, I get approximately 0.0666, which is not 0. However, since we're taking the limit as x approaches infinity, even though for finite x the value is non-zero, it tends to 0 as x grows larger. For example, if x=10^12, as I computed earlier, the value would be around 0.00666, which is smaller, and as x increases further, it keeps getting smaller. So that does make sense. Therefore, the limit should be 0.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe there is a different approach? For example, using L’Hospital’s Rule. Wait, but this is an indeterminate form of type ∞ * 0. To apply L’Hospital’s Rule, I need to convert it into a 0/0 or ∞/∞ form.\n\nLet me rewrite the original expression:\n\nlim_{x→∞} sqrt(x) [ (x+1)^{1/3} - (x-1)^{1/3} ]\n\nLet me denote the expression as sqrt(x) * [f(x+1) - f(x-1)] where f(t) = t^{1/3}\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as [f(x+1) - f(x-1)] / (1/sqrt(x))\n\nSo as x approaches infinity, the numerator tends to 0 and the denominator tends to 0, so it's a 0/0 form. Therefore, maybe L’Hospital’s Rule applies here. Let's try that.\n\nLet me set it up:\n\nlim_{x→∞} [ (x+1)^{1/3} - (x-1)^{1/3} ] / (1/sqrt(x)) = lim_{x→∞} [f(x+1) - f(x-1)] / (x^{-1/2})\n\nNow, take derivatives of numerator and denominator with respect to x:\n\nThe derivative of the numerator:\n\nd/dx [f(x+1) - f(x-1)] = f’(x+1)*(1) - f’(x-1)*(1) = (1/3)(x+1)^{-2/3} - (1/3)(x-1)^{-2/3}\n\nThe derivative of the denominator:\n\nd/dx [x^{-1/2}] = (-1/2)x^{-3/2}\n\nTherefore, applying L’Hospital’s Rule, the limit becomes:\n\nlim_{x→∞} [ (1/3)(x+1)^{-2/3} - (1/3)(x-1)^{-2/3} ] / [ (-1/2)x^{-3/2} ]\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(1/3)[ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ]\n\nDenominator:\n\n(-1/2)x^{-3/2}\n\nTherefore, the expression is:\n\n(1/3) / (-1/2) * [ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ] / x^{-3/2} = (-2/3) * [ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ] / x^{-3/2}\n\nSimplify the division:\n\n[ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ] / x^{-3/2} = [ (x+1)^{-2/3} - (x-1)^{-2/3} ] * x^{3/2}\n\nAgain, we can factor out x^{-2/3} from both terms in the numerator:\n\n(x+1)^{-2/3} = x^{-2/3} (1 + 1/x)^{-2/3}\n\nSimilarly, (x-1)^{-2/3} = x^{-2/3} (1 - 1/x)^{-2/3}\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\nx^{-2/3} [ (1 + 1/x)^{-2/3} - (1 - 1/x)^{-2/3} ] * x^{3/2} = x^{-2/3 + 3/2} [ (1 + 1/x)^{-2/3} - (1 - 1/x)^{-2/3} ]\n\nCalculate exponent:\n\n-2/3 + 3/2 = (-4/6 + 9/6) = 5/6\n\nSo x^{5/6} [ (1 + 1/x)^{-2/3} - (1 - 1/x)^{-2/3} ]\n\nAgain, expand the terms inside the brackets using binomial approximation for h = 1/x:\n\n(1 + h)^{-2/3} ≈ 1 - (2/3)h + ( ( (-2/3)(-2/3 -1) ) / 2 ) h² + ...\n\nWhich is 1 - (2/3)h + ( (10/9)/2 ) h² = 1 - (2/3)h + (5/9)h² + ...\n\nSimilarly, (1 - h)^{-2/3} ≈ 1 + (2/3)h + ( ( (-2/3)(-2/3 -1) ) / 2 ) h² + ... = 1 + (2/3)h + (5/9)h² + ...\n\nSubtracting them:\n\n[1 - (2/3)h + (5/9)h²] - [1 + (2/3)h + (5/9)h²] = - (4/3)h + 0 h² + ... = - (4/3)h + ...\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\nx^{5/6} [ - (4/3)h + ... ] = x^{5/6} [ - (4/3)(1/x) + ... ] = - (4/3) x^{5/6 -1} + ... = - (4/3) x^{-1/6} + ...\n\nWhich tends to 0 as x approaches infinity. Therefore, after applying L’Hospital’s Rule once, we still get an expression that tends to 0. Therefore, the original limit is 0.\n\nWait, but if after applying L’Hospital once, we still have an indeterminate form, can we apply it again? Let me check:\n\nThe expression after first derivative was:\n\nlim_{x→∞} - (4/3) x^{-1/6} + ... which is 0. So actually, after applying L’Hospital once, we have already shown that the limit is 0, so no need to apply it again.\n\nTherefore, all methods seem to confirm that the limit is 0. But I want to check another way just to be thorough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution y = x^{1/6}, so that x = y^6. Then as x approaches infinity, y also approaches infinity.\n\nExpress the original limit in terms of y:\n\nsqrt(x) = sqrt(y^6) = y^3\n\nCube roots:\n\n(x +1)^{1/3} = (y^6 +1)^{1/3} ≈ y^2 (1 + 1/(y^6))^{1/3} ≈ y^2 (1 + 1/(3 y^6))\n\nSimilarly, (x -1)^{1/3} ≈ y^2 (1 - 1/(3 y^6))\n\nSubtracting them:\n\ny^2 [ (1 + 1/(3 y^6)) - (1 - 1/(3 y^6)) ] = y^2 [ 2/(3 y^6) ] = 2/(3 y^4)\n\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = y^3:\n\ny^3 * 2/(3 y^4) = 2/(3 y) which approaches 0 as y approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, again, the limit is 0.\n\nSo all different methods—binomial expansion, mean value theorem, substitution, L’Hospital’s Rule—lead to the conclusion that the limit is 0. Therefore, I should feel confident that the answer is 0.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider another perspective. Suppose we write the difference of cube roots as:\n\n\\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\sqrt[3]{x-1} = \\frac{(x+1) - (x-1)}{(\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2} + \\sqrt[3]{(x+1)(x-1)} + \\sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2})}\n\nThis is using the identity a - b = (a^3 - b^3)/(a^2 + ab + b^2). Here, a = \\sqrt[3]{x+1}, b = \\sqrt[3]{x-1}, so a^3 - b^3 = (x+1) - (x-1) = 2.\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\sqrt[3]{x-1} = 2 / [ (\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2} + \\sqrt[3]{(x+1)(x-1)} + \\sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2} ) ]\n\nSo the original expression becomes:\n\nsqrt(x) * [ 2 / ( (\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2} + \\sqrt[3]{(x+1)(x-1)} + \\sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2} ) ) ]\n\nNow, let's analyze the denominator:\n\nEach term in the denominator is approximately (x)^{2/3} for large x. For example:\n\n\\sqrt[3]{(x+1)^2} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 + 2/(3x))\n\nSimilarly, \\sqrt[3]{(x+1)(x-1)} = \\sqrt[3]{x² -1} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 - 1/x²)^{1/3} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 - 1/(3x²))\n\nAnd \\sqrt[3]{(x-1)^2} ≈ x^{2/3} (1 - 2/(3x))\n\nTherefore, summing these three terms:\n\n≈ x^{2/3} [ (1 + 2/(3x)) + (1 - 1/(3x²)) + (1 - 2/(3x)) ] = x^{2/3} [ 3 - 1/(3x²) ]\n\nTherefore, the denominator ≈ 3 x^{2/3} - negligible terms.\n\nTherefore, the original expression ≈ sqrt(x) * [ 2 / (3 x^{2/3}) ] = (2/3) x^{1/2} / x^{2/3} = (2/3) x^{1/2 - 2/3} = (2/3) x^{-1/6} which tends to 0 as x approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, again, the limit is 0.\n\nSo after considering multiple approaches—binomial expansion, mean value theorem, substitution, algebraic identity—all confirm that the limit is 0. Therefore, I can confidently conclude that the limit is 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0}\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\sqrt{x} \\left( \\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\sqrt[3]{x-1} \\right)\\), we can use several methods to approximate the difference of cube roots and analyze the behavior as \\(x\\) approaches infinity.\n\n1. **Binomial Expansion**:\n   - Factor out \\(x^{1/3}\\) from each cube root:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt[3]{x+1} = x^{1/3} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1/3}, \\quad \\sqrt[3]{x-1} = x^{1/3} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1/3}\n     \\]\n   - Expand using the binomial approximation for small \\(h = \\frac{1}{x}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1/3} - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{x}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx \\frac{2}{3x} - \\frac{10}{81x^3} + \\cdots\n     \\]\n   - Multiply by \\(\\sqrt{x}\\) and simplify:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{x} \\cdot x^{1/3} \\left( \\frac{2}{3x} \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} x^{-1/6} \\to 0 \\text{ as } x \\to \\infty\n     \\]\n\n2. **Mean Value Theorem**:\n   - For \\(f(t) = t^{1/3}\\), there exists \\(c\\) between \\(x-1\\) and \\(x+1\\) such that:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\sqrt[3]{x-1} = \\frac{2}{3} c^{-2/3}\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(c \\approx x\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{x} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} x^{-2/3} = \\frac{2}{3} x^{-1/6} \\to 0 \\text{ as } x \\to \\infty\n     \\]\n\n3. **Substitution**:\n   - Let \\(t = 1/x\\), then as \\(x \\to \\infty\\), \\(t \\to 0\\):\n     \\[\n     t^{-5/6} \\left( \\frac{2}{3}t + \\cdots \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} t^{1/6} \\to 0\n     \\]\n\n4. **Algebraic Identity**:\n   - Use the identity \\(a - b = \\frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^2 + ab + b^2}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\sqrt[3]{x-1} = \\frac{2}{(x+1)^{2/3} + (x+1)^{1/3}(x-1)^{1/3} + (x-1)^{2/3}}\n     \\]\n   - Approximate the denominator as \\(3x^{2/3}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{x} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3x^{2/3}} = \\frac{2}{3} x^{-1/6} \\to 0\n     \\]\n\nAll methods confirm that the limit is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",
      "r1_solution_3": "Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as x approaches infinity of sqrt(x) times (the cube root of (x+1) minus the cube root of (x-1)). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me write it out again to visualize better:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\sqrt{x} \\left( \\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\sqrt[3]{x-1} \\right)\n\\]\n\nFirst, let's recall that when dealing with limits involving roots, especially as variables approach infinity, it's often helpful to factor out the dominant term. Here, as x is going to infinity, the terms +1 and -1 inside the cube roots become negligible compared to x. But since we have a difference of two cube roots, maybe I need to use some algebraic manipulation to simplify this expression. \n\nI remember that for differences of roots, sometimes multiplying by the conjugate helps. For square roots, we multiply by the conjugate to rationalize. Maybe something similar works for cube roots? Let me think. The formula for a^3 - b^3 is (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2). So, if I have a - b, where a and b are cube roots, maybe I can multiply numerator and denominator by something to rationalize them. But here, in our case, the expression is part of a product with sqrt(x). So perhaps I need to use this identity.\n\nLet me set a = cube root of (x + 1) and b = cube root of (x - 1). Then our expression becomes sqrt(x) * (a - b). If I can express (a - b) in terms that can be simplified, maybe the sqrt(x) will cancel out some terms, making the limit computable.\n\nUsing the identity a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2), so rearranged, (a - b) = (a^3 - b^3)/(a^2 + ab + b^2). Let's compute a^3 - b^3 first. Since a is cube root of (x + 1), a^3 is x + 1, and similarly, b^3 is x - 1. Therefore, a^3 - b^3 = (x + 1) - (x - 1) = x + 1 - x + 1 = 2. So, the numerator simplifies to 2. Therefore, (a - b) = 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2). \n\nSo, substituting back into our original expression, the limit becomes:\n\nlim_{x→∞} sqrt(x) * [2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2)]\n\nWhere a = (x + 1)^{1/3} and b = (x - 1)^{1/3}. Now, I need to analyze the denominator a^2 + ab + b^2.\n\nLet's try to express a and b in terms of x. Since x is approaching infinity, both (x + 1) and (x - 1) are approximately x. So, perhaps we can approximate a and b using a binomial expansion or a Taylor series. Let's consider that approach.\n\nFirst, let's write a = (x + 1)^{1/3} and b = (x - 1)^{1/3}. Let's factor out x from both terms. Then,\n\na = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3}\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb = x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3}\n\nSo, both a and b can be expressed as x^{1/3} multiplied by a term that's close to 1 when x is large. Then, maybe I can use the expansion (1 + ε)^n ≈ 1 + nε + (n(n - 1)/2)ε^2 + ... for small ε.\n\nLet's apply this expansion to both (1 + 1/x)^{1/3} and (1 - 1/x)^{1/3}.\n\nFor a:\n\n(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... \n\nSimilarly, for b:\n\n(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... \n\nWait, hold on. The expansion of (1 + ε)^k is 1 + kε + (k(k - 1)/2)ε^2 + (k(k - 1)(k - 2)/6)ε^3 + ... For (1 - ε)^k, it's similar but with alternating signs: 1 - kε + (k(k - 1)/2)ε^2 - (k(k - 1)(k - 2)/6)ε^3 + ...\n\nBut here, k is 1/3 for both expansions. So let me compute the expansion up to the second term because the higher-order terms will become negligible as x approaches infinity.\n\nTherefore, for a:\n\n(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ...\n\nSimilarly, for b:\n\n(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2) + ... \n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify the coefficients. For (1 + ε)^{1/3}, the expansion is:\n\n1 + (1/3)ε - (1/9)ε^2 + (5/81)ε^3 - ... \n\nSimilarly, for (1 - ε)^{1/3}:\n\n1 - (1/3)ε - (1/9)ε^2 - (5/81)ε^3 - ... \n\nSo, up to the second term, that's correct. Therefore, substituting back into a and b:\n\na ≈ x^{1/3}[1 + (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2)]\n\nb ≈ x^{1/3}[1 - (1/3)(1/x) - (1/9)(1/x^2)]\n\nTherefore, expanding these:\n\na ≈ x^{1/3} + (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (1/9)x^{-5/3}\n\nb ≈ x^{1/3} - (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (1/9)x^{-5/3}\n\nSo, then, a - b ≈ [x^{1/3} + (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (1/9)x^{-5/3] - [x^{1/3} - (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (1/9)x^{-5/3}]]\n\nSimplifying:\n\na - b ≈ (1/3)x^{-2/3} - ( -1/3)x^{-2/3} + [ -1/9 x^{-5/3} - (-1/9 x^{-5/3}) ]\n\nWait, let's compute term by term:\n\nx^{1/3} cancels out.\n\nThen, (1/3)x^{-2/3} - (-1/3)x^{-2/3} = (1/3 + 1/3)x^{-2/3} = (2/3)x^{-2/3}\n\nSimilarly, the terms with x^{-5/3}: -1/9 x^{-5/3} - (-1/9 x^{-5/3}) = (-1/9 + 1/9)x^{-5/3} = 0\n\nTherefore, a - b ≈ (2/3)x^{-2/3}\n\nSo, then, sqrt(x)*(a - b) ≈ sqrt(x)*(2/3)x^{-2/3} = (2/3)x^{1/2 - 2/3}\n\nCompute the exponent: 1/2 - 2/3 = 3/6 - 4/6 = -1/6\n\nTherefore, sqrt(x)*(a - b) ≈ (2/3)x^{-1/6} = 2/(3x^{1/6})\n\nAs x approaches infinity, x^{1/6} approaches infinity, so this would approach 0. But wait, but that contradicts our earlier step where we had the denominator. Hmm, maybe this approach is not accurate enough? Because when we did the expansion of (1 + 1/x)^{1/3} and (1 - 1/x)^{1/3}, we went up to the 1/x term, but maybe we need higher-order terms to capture the difference accurately?\n\nWait, let's see. Alternatively, maybe my initial approach using the identity a - b = 2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2) is more promising. Let's go back to that.\n\nSo, we had:\n\nsqrt(x)*(a - b) = sqrt(x)*(2 / (a^2 + ab + b^2))\n\nWe need to compute the denominator a^2 + ab + b^2. Let's express a and b in terms of x. Again, since a = (x + 1)^{1/3} and b = (x - 1)^{1/3}, let's factor out x^{1/3} from both terms:\n\na = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3}\n\nb = x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3}\n\nTherefore, a^2 = x^{2/3}(1 + 1/x)^{2/3}\n\nSimilarly, ab = x^{1/3}(1 + 1/x)^{1/3} * x^{1/3}(1 - 1/x)^{1/3} = x^{2/3}[(1 + 1/x)(1 - 1/x)]^{1/3} = x^{2/3}(1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3}\n\nSimilarly, b^2 = x^{2/3}(1 - 1/x)^{2/3}\n\nTherefore, the denominator a^2 + ab + b^2 is:\n\nx^{2/3}[ (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} + (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} + (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ]\n\nSo, factoring out x^{2/3}, the denominator becomes x^{2/3} times [ (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} + (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} + (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ]\n\nTherefore, putting it back into the expression:\n\nsqrt(x) * [2 / (x^{2/3} * [ (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} + (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} + (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ]) ]\n\nSimplify sqrt(x) as x^{1/2}, so:\n\n2 * x^{1/2} / (x^{2/3} * [ ... ]) ) = 2 * x^{1/2 - 2/3} / [ ... ] = 2 * x^{-1/6} / [ ... ]\n\nSo, 2 / (x^{1/6} * [ (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} + (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} + (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ] )\n\nNow, as x approaches infinity, 1/x approaches 0, so we can expand each term in the denominator using the binomial approximation.\n\nFirst, let's compute each term in the denominator:\n\n1. (1 + 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ 1 + (2/3)(1/x) + [(2/3)(2/3 - 1)/2](1/x)^2 + ... ≈ 1 + (2/(3x)) - (1/(9x^2)) + ...\n\n2. (1 - 1/x^2)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (-1/3)(1/x^2) + ... ≈ 1 - (1/(3x^2)) + ...\n\n3. (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ 1 + (-2/3)(1/x) + [(-2/3)(-2/3 - 1)/2](1/x)^2 + ... ≈ 1 - (2/(3x)) + ( ( (2/3)(5/3) ) / 2 ) (1/x^2) + ... Wait, let me check the expansion:\n\nFor (1 - ε)^{k} ≈ 1 - kε + [k(k - 1)/2]ε^2 - ...\n\nHere, k = 2/3, ε = 1/x.\n\nSo:\n\n(1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ 1 - (2/3)(1/x) + [(2/3)(2/3 - 1)/2](1/x)^2 + ... \n\nCalculating the coefficient of 1/x^2:\n\n(2/3)(-1/3)/2 = (-2/9)/2 = -1/9\n\nSo, (1 - 1/x)^{2/3} ≈ 1 - (2/(3x)) - (1/(9x^2)) + ...\n\nTherefore, adding all three terms in the denominator:\n\nTerm1: 1 + 2/(3x) - 1/(9x^2)\n\nTerm2: 1 - 1/(3x^2)\n\nTerm3: 1 - 2/(3x) - 1/(9x^2)\n\nAdding them together:\n\n(1 + 1 + 1) + [2/(3x) - 2/(3x)] + [ -1/(9x^2) -1/(3x^2) -1/(9x^2) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n3 + 0 + [ (-1/9 - 3/9 - 1/9 ) / x^2 ] = 3 + (-5/9)/x^2\n\nSo, the denominator [ ... ] ≈ 3 - 5/(9x^2)\n\nTherefore, going back to the expression:\n\n2 / [x^{1/6} * (3 - 5/(9x^2)) ] = (2/3) / [x^{1/6} * (1 - 5/(27x^2)) ]\n\nAgain, as x approaches infinity, the term 5/(27x^2) is negligible, so we can approximate (1 - 5/(27x^2))^{-1} ≈ 1 + 5/(27x^2) + ... using the expansion 1/(1 - ε) ≈ 1 + ε for small ε.\n\nBut since x is approaching infinity, 5/(27x^2) is very small, so multiplying by 1 + 5/(27x^2) would give a term that tends to 0. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to (2/3)/x^{1/6} plus terms that go to 0 faster. Therefore, as x approaches infinity, the whole expression tends to 0.\n\nWait, but earlier, when I did the expansion of a - b directly, I also got that the expression tends to 0, but when I first thought of the problem, maybe I expected a non-zero limit? Hmm, perhaps I need to check again.\n\nBut both methods lead to the conclusion that the limit is 0. However, maybe there's a mistake in my approximations. Let's cross-verify with another approach. Maybe using substitution.\n\nLet me set t = 1/x as x approaches infinity, so t approaches 0. Then, x = 1/t. Let's rewrite the expression in terms of t.\n\nFirst, sqrt(x) = (1/t)^{1/2} = t^{-1/2}\n\nThen, cube roots:\n\ncube root(x + 1) = cube root(1/t + 1) = cube root( (1 + t)/t ) = (1 + t)^{1/3} / t^{1/3}\n\nSimilarly, cube root(x - 1) = cube root(1/t - 1) = cube root( (1 - t)/t ) = (1 - t)^{1/3} / t^{1/3}\n\nTherefore, the difference:\n\ncube root(x + 1) - cube root(x - 1) = [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{1/3}\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\nsqrt(x) * [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{1/3} = t^{-1/2} * [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{1/3} = [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{1/3 + 1/2} = [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{5/6}\n\nNow, as t approaches 0, we can expand (1 + t)^{1/3} and (1 - t)^{1/3} using their Taylor series around t = 0.\n\n(1 + t)^{1/3} = 1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + (5/81)t^3 - ... \n\n(1 - t)^{1/3} = 1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 - (5/81)t^3 - ... \n\nSubtracting these:\n\n(1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ [1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2] - [1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2] = (1/3)t - (-1/3)t + [ -1/9 t^2 - (-1/9 t^2) ] = (2/3)t + 0 t^2 + higher order terms\n\nTherefore, the numerator is approximately (2/3)t, and the denominator is t^{5/6}. So, the entire expression becomes approximately (2/3)t / t^{5/6} = (2/3) t^{1 - 5/6} = (2/3) t^{1/6} = (2/3) (1/x)^{1/6} = (2/3) x^{-1/6}, which tends to 0 as x approaches infinity. Therefore, this substitution method also gives 0.\n\nHmm, so all three approaches seem to indicate that the limit is 0. But let's check with specific large values to see if it makes sense. Let's pick x = 10^6. Then, sqrt(x) = 1000.\n\nCompute cube root(10^6 + 1) - cube root(10^6 - 1). Let's approximate:\n\ncube root(10^6 + 1) ≈ cube root(10^6) + derivative of cube root at 10^6 * 1\n\nThe derivative of x^{1/3} is (1/3)x^{-2/3}. At x = 10^6, this is (1/3)(10^{-4}) = 1/(3*10^4) ≈ 0.000033333.\n\nSimilarly, cube root(10^6 - 1) ≈ cube root(10^6) - derivative at 10^6 * 1 ≈ 100 - 0.000033333.\n\nTherefore, the difference is approximately 0.000033333 + 0.000033333 ≈ 0.000066666.\n\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = 1000: 0.000066666 * 1000 ≈ 0.066666...\n\nSo, around 2/30 ≈ 0.0666. Wait, but according to our previous calculations, the limit is 0. Hmm, but 0.0666 is a small number, but not zero. However, when x increases further, say x = 10^{12}, then sqrt(x) = 10^6.\n\nThe difference cube root(x +1 ) - cube root(x -1 ) ≈ 2 * derivative at x = 10^{12} which is (2/3)x^{-2/3} = (2/3)(10^{-8}) ≈ 0.0000000666.\n\nMultiply by sqrt(x) = 10^6: 0.0000000666 * 10^6 ≈ 0.0666. So again, same value. Wait, so if x increases, the value approaches approximately 0.0666, which is 2/30 = 1/15 ≈ 0.0667. So, 2/30 is 1/15, but 1/15 ≈ 0.0667. Wait, but according to our symbolic calculations, the limit is 0. However, the numerical evaluation for x=10^6 and x=10^12 gives around 0.0666, which is 2/30, which reduces to 1/15. Hmm, this suggests that maybe the limit is 2/3 divided by 3, which is 2/9, but 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Hmm, no. Wait, perhaps my numerical approach is missing something.\n\nWait, let's compute more accurately. Let's take x = 10^6. Then, x + 1 = 1000001, and x - 1 = 999999. Let's compute cube roots.\n\nCube root of 1000000 is 100, since 100^3 = 1,000,000. Then, cube root(1000001) can be approximated as 100 + Δ, and cube root(999999) as 100 - Δ.\n\nUsing the linear approximation:\n\nΔ ≈ derivative at x=100^3=1,000,000 times 1. The derivative of x^{1/3} is (1/3)x^{-2/3} = (1/3)(100^{-2}) = 1/(3*10,000) ≈ 0.000033333.\n\nTherefore, cube_root(1,000,001) ≈ 100 + 0.000033333\n\nCube_root(999,999) ≈ 100 - 0.000033333\n\nTherefore, the difference is approximately 0.000066666\n\nMultiply by sqrt(x)=1000:\n\n0.000066666 * 1000 ≈ 0.066666...\n\nWhich is approximately 2/30 ≈ 1/15 ≈ 0.0667.\n\nBut according to our symbolic calculation, the limit is 0. However, this numerical evaluation suggests that as x increases, the expression approaches approximately 0.0667, which is 1/15. There's a discrepancy here. Therefore, there must be an error in our symbolic calculations. Let's review them.\n\nFirst approach: We used the identity a - b = 2/(a^2 + ab + b^2). Then, we approximated the denominator as x^{2/3}[3 - 5/(9x^2)] leading to 3x^{2/3}, so the expression became sqrt(x) * 2/(3x^{2/3}) = 2/(3x^{1/6}) → 0. However, the numerical value contradicts this. Therefore, perhaps the approximation of the denominator was too crude?\n\nWait, let's see. When we did the substitution t = 1/x, we ended up with [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{5/6} ≈ (2/3 t) / t^{5/6} = (2/3) t^{1/6} → 0 as t → 0. But the numerical evaluation seems to approach a constant. Therefore, either the numerical evaluation is misleading, or the symbolic approaches are missing something.\n\nWait, let's consider higher-order terms in the expansion. Let's go back to the substitution approach where t = 1/x. Then, the expression is [ (1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ] / t^{5/6}\n\nIf we take more terms in the expansion:\n\n(1 + t)^{1/3} ≈ 1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + (5/81)t^3 - (10/243)t^4 + ...\n\n(1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ 1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 - (5/81)t^3 - (10/243)t^4 + ...\n\nSubtracting:\n\n(1 + t)^{1/3} - (1 - t)^{1/3} ≈ [1 + (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 + (5/81)t^3] - [1 - (1/3)t - (1/9)t^2 - (5/81)t^3] = (2/3)t + (10/81)t^3 + ... \n\nTherefore, the numerator is (2/3)t + (10/81)t^3 + ..., and the denominator is t^{5/6}. So, the expression becomes:\n\n[ (2/3)t + (10/81)t^3 + ... ] / t^{5/6} = (2/3) t^{1 - 5/6} + (10/81) t^{3 - 5/6} + ... = (2/3) t^{1/6} + (10/81) t^{13/6} + ... \n\nSo as t approaches 0, the dominant term is (2/3) t^{1/6}, which tends to 0. However, in the numerical evaluation, when x = 10^6, t = 1e-6, t^{1/6} = (1e-6)^{1/6} = (1e-6)^{1/6} = (1e-6)^{1/6} = 1e-1 = 0.1. Then, (2/3)*0.1 ≈ 0.0666, which matches the numerical result. Similarly, if x = 1e12, t = 1e-12, t^{1/6} = 1e-2, so (2/3)*1e-2 ≈ 0.00666, but in the numerical example, we had x=1e12 giving the same 0.0666? Wait, that seems contradictory. Wait, no. Wait, when x = 1e12, t = 1e-12, t^{1/6} = (1e-12)^{1/6} = (1e-12)^{1/6} = 1e-2, since (1e-12)^{1/6} = (1e-12)^{1/6} = 10^{-12*(1/6)} = 10^{-2} = 0.01. Therefore, (2/3)*0.01 ≈ 0.006666..., but in reality, for x = 1e12, the actual value would be:\n\nsqrt(x) = 1e6.\n\nThe difference in cube roots: derivative is (1/3)x^{-2/3} = (1/3)(1e12)^{-2/3} = (1/3)(1e-8) = 1/(3e8) ≈ 3.333e-9. Multiply by 2 gives ≈ 6.666e-9. Then, multiply by sqrt(x)=1e6: 6.666e-9 *1e6 ≈ 6.666e-3 ≈ 0.006666. Which is indeed (2/3)*0.01 ≈ 0.006666. So, as x increases, the value of the expression decreases towards 0. But when x=1e6, t=1e-6, t^{1/6}=1e-1, giving 0.0666, which is 1/15. When x increases to 1e12, it becomes 0.00666, which is 1/150. So, it's approaching 0 as x approaches infinity, but very slowly. Therefore, our symbolic analysis is correct, and the limit is indeed 0. The numerical examples show that as x increases, the value gets smaller, tending towards 0. So even though for x=1e6 it's around 0.0666, for x=1e18, it would be (2/3)*(1e-18)^{1/6} = (2/3)*(1e-3) ≈ 0.000666..., tending to 0.\n\nTherefore, all methods confirm that the limit is 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0}\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\sqrt{x} \\left( \\sqrt[3]{x+1} - \\sqrt[3]{x-1} \\right)\\), we can use algebraic manipulation and asymptotic expansions.\n\nFirst, we use the identity for the difference of cube roots:\n\\[\na - b = \\frac{a^3 - b^3}{a^2 + ab + b^2}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a = \\sqrt[3]{x+1}\\) and \\(b = \\sqrt[3]{x-1}\\).

      "r1_solution_1": "Okay, so I need to find the auxiliary equation for the given ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients: \\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\sin(2\\log x)\\sin(\\log x)\\). Hmm, let me start by recalling what an auxiliary equation is. From my classes, I remember that for linear ODEs with constant coefficients, we often use characteristic equations, which are also called auxiliary equations. These are polynomial equations obtained by replacing the differential operator \\(D\\) with a variable, usually \\(m\\), and solving for \\(m\\). The roots of this equation help determine the general solution to the homogeneous equation.\n\nBut wait, the given differential equation here is \\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\sin(2\\log x)\\sin(\\log x)\\). The operator here is \\(x^2D^2 + xD + 1\\), which involves variable coefficients since \\(x\\) is multiplied with the differential operators. However, the problem states that it's an ODE with constant coefficients. That seems contradictory. Maybe there's a substitution that can convert this into an equation with constant coefficients?\n\nI think when the differential equation has terms like \\(x^2D^2\\), \\(xD\\), etc., it might be a Cauchy-Euler equation. Cauchy-Euler equations are linear ODEs with variable coefficients, but they can be transformed into constant coefficient equations by using a substitution. The standard form of a Cauchy-Euler equation is \\(ax^2y'' + bxy' + cy = f(x)\\), which looks similar to our given equation. So, if this is a Cauchy-Euler equation, then we can make the substitution \\(t = \\log x\\) to convert it into a constant coefficient ODE.\n\nLet me try that. Let \\(t = \\log x\\). Then, \\(x = e^t\\), and we can express the derivatives with respect to \\(x\\) in terms of derivatives with respect to \\(t\\). \n\nFirst, compute \\(dy/dx\\). Using the chain rule: \\(\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{dt} \\cdot \\frac{dt}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{dt} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x}\\). So, \\(x\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{dt}\\).\n\nNext, compute the second derivative. Let's denote \\(D = \\frac{d}{dx}\\), so \\(D = \\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\cdot \\frac{dt}{dx} = \\frac{1}{x}\\frac{d}{dt}\\). Therefore, \\(D^2 = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\frac{d}{dt}\\right)\\). Let's compute that:\n\nFirst derivative operator: \\(D = \\frac{1}{x}\\frac{d}{dt}\\).\n\nSecond derivative: \\(D^2 = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\frac{d}{dt}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{x^2}\\frac{d}{dt} + \\frac{1}{x}\\frac{d}{dx}\\frac{d}{dt}\\).\n\nNow, \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{d}{dx}\\) since mixed partial derivatives commute (assuming the function is nice). Wait, actually, no. Let's see. \\(\\frac{d}{dt} = x\\frac{d}{dx}\\), so \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dx}(x\\frac{d}{dx}) = \\frac{d}{dx} + x\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}\\). Hmm, maybe there's a better way to compute \\(D^2\\).\n\nAlternatively, using the chain rule again. Let's denote \\(D_t = \\frac{d}{dt}\\). Then, since \\(t = \\log x\\), \\(dt/dx = 1/x\\), so \\(D = \\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{1}{x} D_t\\). Therefore, \\(x D = D_t\\), and \\(x^2 D^2 = x D (x D) - x D\\). Wait, this might be a better approach.\n\nLet me recall that for the Cauchy-Euler equation, when we make the substitution \\(t = \\log x\\), the operator \\(x D\\) becomes \\(D_t\\), and \\(x^2 D^2\\) becomes \\(D_t(D_t - 1)\\). Let me verify this.\n\nStarting with \\(x D = D_t\\), as we saw earlier. Then, \\(x^2 D^2 = x D (x D) - x D\\). Applying \\(x D\\) to \\(x D\\), we have \\(x D (x D y) = x D (x y') = x (y' + x y'')\\). Which is \\(x y' + x^2 y''\\). Therefore, \\(x^2 D^2 = x D (x D) - x D = (x D)^2 - x D\\). Since \\(x D = D_t\\), this becomes \\(D_t^2 - D_t\\). Therefore, \\(x^2 D^2 = D_t(D_t - 1)\\).\n\nSo, substituting into the original operator \\(x^2 D^2 + x D + 1\\), we get:\n\n\\(D_t(D_t - 1) + D_t + 1 = D_t^2 - D_t + D_t + 1 = D_t^2 + 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the original differential equation \\(x^2 D^2 y + x D y + y = \\sin(2 \\log x) \\sin(\\log x)\\) transforms into \\(D_t^2 y + y = \\sin(2 t) \\sin(t)\\), where \\(t = \\log x\\).\n\nSo, now we have a constant coefficient ODE in terms of \\(t\\):\n\n\\(y''(t) + y(t) = \\sin(2t) \\sin(t)\\).\n\nTherefore, the auxiliary equation is obtained by considering the homogeneous equation \\(y'' + y = 0\\). The characteristic (auxiliary) equation is \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\). Solving this gives \\(m = \\pm i\\), which are complex roots. But since the problem only asks for the auxiliary equation, not its roots or the solution, the answer is \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. The original equation was converted to a constant coefficient equation via substitution, and then the auxiliary equation is for the transformed equation. The problem statement mentions \"the ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients\", which probably refers to the transformed equation after the substitution. Therefore, the auxiliary equation is indeed \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\).\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's check again. The original equation is a Cauchy-Euler equation, which typically requires the substitution \\(t = \\log x\\) to turn it into a constant coefficient linear ODE. Once we do that substitution, the equation becomes \\(y''(t) + y(t) = \\sin(2t)\\sin(t)\\), as I found. Then, the homogeneous part is \\(y'' + y = 0\\), whose auxiliary equation is \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the question had asked for the auxiliary equation associated directly with the original equation (even though it's variable coefficient), but the problem says \"with constant coefficients\", which suggests that perhaps we need to consider the equation after substitution. Because the original equation isn't constant coefficient, but after substitution, it is. So, the auxiliary equation is for the transformed constant coefficient equation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\). So, boxed, it's \\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}\n</think>\n\nTo find the auxiliary equation for the given ordinary differential equation \\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\sin(2\\log x)\\sin(\\log x)\\), we recognize it as a Cauchy-Euler equation. We use the substitution \\(t = \\log x\\) to convert it into a constant coefficient ODE.\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let \\(t = \\log x\\). Then, \\(x = e^t\\) and the differential operators transform as follows:\n   - \\(x \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{dt}\\)\n   - \\(x^2 \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \\frac{dy}{dt}\\)\n\n2. **Transforming the Equation**: Substituting these into the original equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   x^2 D^2 y + x D y + y = \\sin(2 \\log x) \\sin(\\log x)\n   \\]\n   transforms into:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} - \\frac{dy}{dt}\\right) + \\frac{dy}{dt} + y = \\sin(2t) \\sin(t)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we obtain:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + y = \\sin(2t) \\sin(t)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Auxiliary Equation**: The homogeneous part of the transformed equation is \\(\\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + y = 0\\). The auxiliary equation for this is:\n   \\[\n   m^2 + 1 = 0\n   \\]\n\nThus, the auxiliary equation for the given differential equation is \\(\\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}\\).",
      "r1_solution_2": "Okay, so I need to find the auxiliary equation for this ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients: \\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\sin(2\\log x)\\sin(\\log x)\\). Hmm, let me start by recalling what an auxiliary equation is. From what I remember, the auxiliary equation (also called the characteristic equation) is a polynomial equation obtained by replacing the differential operator \\(D\\) with a variable \\(m\\), right? This is used to find the solution to the homogeneous equation. But wait, the given ODE here is nonhomogeneous because of the right-hand side. But the question specifically asks for the auxiliary equation, so maybe I just need to focus on the left-hand side?\n\nFirst, let me parse the differential equation. It's written as \\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\sin(2\\log x)\\sin(\\log x)\\), where \\(D\\) is the differential operator \\(d/dx\\). However, the problem mentions that the ODE has constant coefficients, but I see \\(x^2\\) and \\(x\\) multiplied by the derivatives. That seems variable coefficient, not constant. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe there's a substitution involved here? Because if the coefficients are constants, but the equation has \\(x^2\\) and \\(x\\), perhaps they are using a different independent variable?\n\nAh, yes, Euler-Cauchy equations! I remember those. They are equations of the form \\(x^2y'' + axy' + by = 0\\), which have variable coefficients but can be transformed into constant coefficient equations by substituting \\(t = \\log x\\). Let me confirm that.\n\nSo, if we let \\(t = \\log x\\), then \\(x = e^t\\), and the derivatives transform as follows:\n\nFirst derivative: \\(dy/dx = (dy/dt)(dt/dx) = (1/x) dy/dt\\).\n\nSecond derivative: \\(d^2y/dx^2 = d/dx ( (1/x) dy/dt ) = - (1/x^2) dy/dt + (1/x) d/dx (dy/dt)\\).\n\nBut \\(d/dx (dy/dt) = (d^2y/dt^2)(dt/dx) = (1/x) d^2y/dt^2\\).\n\nSo, putting it together, the second derivative is:\n\n\\(d^2y/dx^2 = - (1/x^2) dy/dt + (1/x^2) d^2y/dt^2 = (1/x^2)(d^2y/dt^2 - dy/dt)\\).\n\nTherefore, substituting into the original equation:\n\n\\(x^2D^2y + xDy + y = x^2*( (1/x^2)(y'' - y') ) + x*( (1/x)y' ) + y = (y'' - y') + y' + y = y'' + y\\).\n\nSo, the transformed equation is \\(y'' + y = \\sin(2t)\\sin(t)\\), since \\(t = \\log x\\).\n\nTherefore, the left-hand side becomes a constant coefficient equation \\(y'' + y = \\text{right-hand side}\\). So, the auxiliary equation would be obtained from the homogeneous equation \\(y'' + y = 0\\), which is \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\). Therefore, the auxiliary equation is \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\), right?\n\nWait, let me check again. The original equation is \\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\sin(2\\log x)\\sin(\\log x)\\). After substitution \\(t = \\log x\\), the operator \\(x^2D^2 + xD + 1\\) becomes \\(D_t^2 + 1\\), where \\(D_t\\) is the derivative with respect to \\(t\\). So, yes, the transformed equation is \\(y'' + y = \\sin(2t)\\sin(t)\\), and the auxiliary equation is \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\), which can be written as \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\).\n\nBut let me verify once more to ensure I didn't skip any steps. So, the original differential operator is \\(x^2D_x^2 + xD_x + 1\\). To convert this into a constant coefficient operator, we use the substitution \\(t = \\log x\\), which implies that \\(D_x = (1/x)D_t\\), as I did before. Then:\n\n\\(x^2D_x^2 = x^2*(D_x)^2 = x^2*( (1/x)D_t )^2 = x^2*(1/x^2)D_t^2 - x^2*(1/x^2)D_t = D_t^2 - D_t\\).\n\nWait, let me compute this carefully. The first derivative operator \\(D_x\\) is \\( (1/x) D_t \\). Then, the second derivative \\(D_x^2\\) is \\( D_x (D_x) = D_x ( (1/x) D_t ) \\). Applying the product rule:\n\n\\( D_x ( (1/x) D_t ) = (D_x(1/x)) D_t + (1/x) D_x D_t \\).\n\nCompute \\( D_x (1/x) = -1/x^2 \\). Then, \\( D_x D_t = D_t D_x \\), but since \\( D_t \\) is \\( x D_x \\), maybe there's a commutation relation here. Wait, maybe it's simpler to express everything in terms of \\( t \\).\n\nAlternatively, using the chain rule again. Let's see, if \\( t = \\log x \\), then \\( dt/dx = 1/x \\), so \\( d/dx = (1/x) d/dt \\). Therefore, \\( D_x = (1/x) D_t \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( x D_x = x*(1/x) D_t = D_t \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( x^2 D_x^2 = x^2 * D_x (D_x) = x^2 * D_x ( (1/x) D_t ) \\).\n\nCompute \\( D_x ( (1/x) D_t ) = (D_x (1/x)) D_t + (1/x) D_x D_t \\).\n\nFirst term: \\( D_x (1/x) = -1/x^2 \\), so that term is \\( -1/x^2 D_t \\).\n\nSecond term: \\( (1/x) D_x D_t \\). Now, \\( D_x D_t \\) is the same as \\( D_t D_x \\), but since \\( D_t = x D_x \\), perhaps we can write:\n\nWait, \\( D_t = x D_x \\), so \\( D_x = (1/x) D_t \\). Then \\( D_x D_t = (1/x) D_t D_t = (1/x) D_t^2 \\).\n\nWait, actually, operators don't commute in general. Let's compute \\( D_x D_t \\).\n\nGiven that \\( D_t = x D_x \\), so \\( D_x D_t = D_x (x D_x) = (D_x x) D_x + x D_x^2 = (1) D_x + x D_x^2 \\).\n\nBut \\( D_x = (1/x) D_t \\), so substitute:\n\n\\( D_x D_t = (1/x) D_t + x D_x^2 \\).\n\nHmm, this seems getting complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is better.\n\nWait, we have:\n\n\\( x^2 D_x^2 + x D_x + 1 \\).\n\nExpressed in terms of \\( t \\), where \\( t = \\log x \\), then \\( D_x = (1/x) D_t \\), so \\( x D_x = D_t \\), and \\( x^2 D_x^2 = x^2 (D_x)^2 = x^2 ( (1/x) D_t )^2 - x^2 (1/x^2) D_t \\). Wait, no, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for transforming derivatives:\n\nIf \\( t = \\log x \\), then \\( y'(x) = dy/dx = (dy/dt)(dt/dx) = (1/x) dy/dt \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( y''(x) = d/dx ( (1/x) dy/dt ) = - (1/x^2) dy/dt + (1/x) d/dx ( dy/dt ) \\).\n\nBut \\( d/dx ( dy/dt ) = (d^2 y)/(dt^2) (dt/dx) = (1/x) (d^2 y)/(dt^2) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( y''(x) = - (1/x^2) dy/dt + (1/x^2) d^2 y/dt^2 \\).\n\nMultiply by \\( x^2 \\):\n\n\\( x^2 y''(x) = - dy/dt + d^2 y/dt^2 \\).\n\nSo the operator \\( x^2 D_x^2 \\) becomes \\( D_t^2 - D_t \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( x D_x \\) is \\( D_t \\).\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\n\\( x^2 D_x^2 + x D_x + 1 = (D_t^2 - D_t) + D_t + 1 = D_t^2 + 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the transformed operator is \\( D_t^2 + 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the original ODE becomes \\( (D_t^2 + 1) y = \\sin(2t) \\sin(t) \\).\n\nSo, the homogeneous equation is \\( y'' + y = 0 \\), which has the auxiliary equation \\( m^2 + 1 = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the auxiliary equation is \\( m^2 + 1 = 0 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be \\( m^2 + 1 = 0 \\), boxed as \\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check if there's any chance that the substitution affects the auxiliary equation. Since the substitution converts the variable coefficient equation into a constant coefficient one, the auxiliary equation is derived from the transformed equation, which is indeed \\( y'' + y = 0 \\). So, yes, the auxiliary equation is \\( m^2 + 1 = 0 \\).\n\nI don't see any mistakes in the substitution steps. The key was recognizing that the original equation is an Euler-Cauchy equation, which requires a substitution \\( t = \\log x \\) to transform it into a constant coefficient linear ODE. Once transformed, the auxiliary equation is straightforward.\n\nSo, yeah, the auxiliary equation is definitely \\( m^2 + 1 = 0 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe auxiliary equation is \\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the auxiliary equation for the ordinary differential equation \\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\sin(2\\log x)\\sin(\\log x)\\) with constant coefficients, we recognize that this is an Euler-Cauchy equation. We use the substitution \\(t = \\log x\\) to transform the equation into one with constant coefficients.\n\n1. **Substitution**: Let \\(t = \\log x\\). Then, \\(x = e^t\\) and the differential operators transform as follows:\n   - \\(D_x = \\frac{d}{dx} = \\frac{1}{x} \\frac{d}{dt} = \\frac{1}{x} D_t\\)\n   - \\(x D_x = D_t\\)\n   - \\(x^2 D_x^2 = D_t^2 - D_t\\)\n\n2. **Transforming the equation**: Applying these transformations to the original differential operator:\n   \\[\n   x^2 D_x^2 + x D_x + 1 = (D_t^2 - D_t) + D_t + 1 = D_t^2 + 1\n   \\]\n   This transforms the original equation into:\n   \\[\n   (D_t^2 + 1)y = \\sin(2t)\\sin(t)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Homogeneous equation**: The homogeneous version of the transformed equation is:\n   \\[\n   y'' + y = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Auxiliary equation**: The auxiliary equation corresponding to the homogeneous equation \\(y'' + y = 0\\) is found by replacing \\(y''\\) with \\(m^2\\) and \\(y\\) with 1:\n   \\[\n   m^2 + 1 = 0\n   \\]\n\nThus, the auxiliary equation for the given differential equation is \\(\\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}\\).",
      "r1_solution_3": "Okay, so I need to find the auxiliary equation for the given ordinary differential equation (ODE) with constant coefficients: \\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\sin(2\\log x)\\sin(\\log x)\\). Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that when dealing with linear ODEs with variable coefficients, especially ones that have terms like \\(x^2D^2\\) and \\(xD\\), a common technique is to use a substitution to transform the equation into one with constant coefficients. The substitution usually involves changing the independent variable from \\(x\\) to another variable, say \\(t\\), which is a logarithm function of \\(x\\). \n\nLet me recall the exact substitution. Since we have terms like \\(x^n D^n\\), this makes me think of the Cauchy-Euler equation, which typically has the form \\(x^n y^{(n)} + \\dots + a_1 x y' + a_0 y = f(x)\\). For such equations, the substitution \\(t = \\log x\\) (or sometimes \\(t = \\ln x\\)) is used to convert the equation into a linear ODE with constant coefficients. That seems to fit here because the given equation has \\(x^2D^2\\), \\(xD\\), and constant coefficient 1. So, let's try that substitution.\n\nLet me set \\(t = \\log x\\). Then, \\(x = e^t\\). Now, I need to express the differential operators \\(D = \\frac{d}{dx}\\) in terms of \\(t\\). Let's compute the derivatives. \n\nFirst, if \\(t = \\log x\\), then \\(dt/dx = 1/x\\), so \\(dx/dt = x\\). Wait, that might be useful. Let me consider the chain rule. If \\(y\\) is a function of \\(x\\), and \\(x\\) is a function of \\(t\\), then the derivative of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(t\\) is \\(dy/dt = dy/dx * dx/dt = x dy/dx\\). So, \\(dy/dt = x dy/dx\\), which implies that \\(x D = d/dt\\). Therefore, \\(x D = \\frac{d}{dt}\\). Let's denote \\(D_t = \\frac{d}{dt}\\), so \\(x D = D_t\\).\n\nNow, let's compute \\(x^2 D^2\\). Starting with \\(x D = D_t\\), applying \\(x D\\) again: \\(x D (x D) = x D D_t\\). Wait, maybe I need to compute \\(x^2 D^2 y\\) in terms of \\(t\\). Let's do it step by step.\n\nFirst, \\(dy/dx = dy/dt * dt/dx = (dy/dt) * (1/x)\\). So, \\(D = d/dx = (1/x) d/dt\\). Then, \\(x D = d/dt\\), which confirms the earlier result. Now, let's compute \\(x^2 D^2\\). \n\nLet's compute \\(D^2 = d^2/dx^2\\). Using the chain rule again, \\(D^2 y = d/dx (d/dx y) = d/dx [(1/x) dy/dt]\\). Applying the derivative:\n\n\\(d/dx [(1/x) dy/dt] = - (1/x^2) dy/dt + (1/x) d/dx (dy/dt)\\).\n\nNow, \\(d/dx (dy/dt)\\) is \\(d^2 y/dt^2 * dt/dx = (d^2 y/dt^2)(1/x)\\).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n\\(D^2 y = - (1/x^2) dy/dt + (1/x^2) d^2 y/dt^2\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(x^2 D^2 y = - dy/dt + d^2 y/dt^2 = D_t^2 y - D_t y\\).\n\nSo, substituting back into the original ODE:\n\n\\(x^2 D^2 y + x D y + y = (D_t^2 - D_t) y + D_t y + y = D_t^2 y - D_t y + D_t y + y = D_t^2 y + y\\).\n\nTherefore, the left-hand side of the equation simplifies to \\(D_t^2 y + y\\). So, the ODE becomes:\n\n\\(D_t^2 y + y = \\sin(2\\log x)\\sin(\\log x)\\).\n\nBut since \\(t = \\log x\\), the right-hand side becomes \\(\\sin(2t)\\sin(t)\\). Let me simplify that using a trigonometric identity. Recall that \\(\\sin A \\sin B = [\\cos(A - B) - \\cos(A + B)] / 2\\). So:\n\n\\(\\sin(2t)\\sin(t) = [\\cos(2t - t) - \\cos(2t + t)] / 2 = [\\cos(t) - \\cos(3t)] / 2\\).\n\nTherefore, the ODE in terms of \\(t\\) is:\n\n\\(y'' + y = \\frac{1}{2} \\cos t - \\frac{1}{2} \\cos 3t\\).\n\nNow, the auxiliary equation for the homogeneous equation \\(y'' + y = 0\\) is found by replacing \\(y''\\) with \\(m^2\\) and \\(y\\) with 1, giving \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\). Solving this, the roots are \\(m = \\pm i\\). So, the homogeneous solution is \\(y_h = C_1 \\cos t + C_2 \\sin t\\).\n\nBut the question asks for the auxiliary equation of the given ODE. Wait, the original ODE is nonhomogeneous, but the auxiliary equation is associated with the homogeneous equation. The auxiliary equation itself is just the characteristic equation obtained from the homogeneous part. So even though the right-hand side has sines and cosines, the auxiliary equation is determined solely by the left-hand side after substitution.\n\nSo, after substitution, the left-hand side becomes \\(y'' + y\\), so the auxiliary equation is \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\). Therefore, the answer should be \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\).\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. The original equation is in terms of \\(x\\), but after substitution, it's transformed into a constant coefficient equation in terms of \\(t\\). The auxiliary equation is derived from the homogeneous part of the transformed equation, which is \\(y'' + y = 0\\), leading to \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\). Therefore, the auxiliary equation is indeed \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\).\n\nBut let me double-check the substitution steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Let's rederive \\(x^2 D^2 y\\) in terms of \\(t\\). Starting with \\(D = d/dx = (1/x) d/dt\\), so \\(x D = d/dt\\). Then \\(x^2 D^2 = x D (x D) - x D\\). Wait, hold on. Let's compute \\(x^2 D^2 y\\):\n\nFirst, \\(x D y = d y / dt\\).\n\nThen, \\(x D (x D y) = x D (dy/dt) = x * d/dx (dy/dt)\\).\n\nBut \\(dy/dt\\) is a function of \\(t\\), so \\(d/dx (dy/dt) = d/dt (dy/dt) * dt/dx = (d^2 y/dt^2) * (1/x)\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(x D (x D y) = x * (1/x) d^2 y/dt^2 = d^2 y/dt^2\\).\n\nBut \\(x^2 D^2 y = x D (x D y) - x D y = d^2 y/dt^2 - d y/dt\\). \n\nWait, so that's the same result as before: \\(x^2 D^2 y = y'' - y'\\) where \\(y'' = d^2 y/dt^2\\) and \\(y' = dy/dt\\). Then, adding \\(x D y = dy/dt\\) gives:\n\n\\(x^2 D^2 y + x D y + y = (y'' - y') + y' + y = y'' + y\\). So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the transformed equation is \\(y'' + y = \\sin(2t)\\sin(t)\\), which simplifies to \\(y'' + y = [\\cos t - \\cos 3t]/2\\). \n\nTherefore, the homogeneous part is \\(y'' + y = 0\\), so the auxiliary equation is \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\). Thus, the answer should be \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\), which is the auxiliary equation.\n\nBut let me check if the original problem was written correctly. The user specified \"the ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients\". However, the given equation has variable coefficients because of the \\(x^2 D^2\\) and \\(xD\\) terms. But after substitution \\(t = \\log x\\), it becomes a constant coefficient equation. So, the problem is about transforming a variable coefficient ODE into a constant coefficient one via substitution, and then finding the auxiliary equation of the resulting equation.\n\nTherefore, the key steps were recognizing the Cauchy-Euler type equation, performing the substitution \\(t = \\log x\\), converting the differential operators, simplifying the equation, and then writing down the auxiliary equation from the homogeneous part. \n\nSo, all steps check out. The auxiliary equation is \\(m^2 + 1 = 0\\). Therefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe auxiliary equation is \\boxed{m^2 + 1 = 0}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the auxiliary equation for the given ordinary differential equation \\((x^2D^2 + xD + 1)y = \\sin(2\\log x)\\sin(\\log x)\\), we start by recognizing that the equation is a Cauchy-Euler type equation.

      "r1_solution_1": "Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of (1/tan²x - 1/x²). Hmm, let me start by understanding what's going on here. When x approaches 0, tanx behaves like x, right? So tanx ≈ x + x³/3 + ... So tan²x ≈ x² + 2x⁴/3 + ... Therefore, 1/tan²x is approximately 1/x² - 2/3 + ... So if I subtract 1/x² from that, the 1/x² terms cancel out, and I'm left with -2/3. So maybe the limit is -2/3? But wait, let me check that properly step by step because maybe my approximation is too rough.\n\nAlternatively, I can write the expression as (1/tan²x - 1/x²). Let's combine these two terms into a single fraction. To do that, I need a common denominator, which would be x² tan²x. So:\n\n[ x² - tan²x ] / [x² tan²x]\n\nSo the expression becomes (x² - tan²x)/(x² tan²x). Now, as x approaches 0, both numerator and denominator approach 0. So we can try applying L’Hospital’s Rule. But since both numerator and denominator approach 0, we can apply L’Hospital once, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, expand tanx in terms of Taylor series around 0.\n\nRecall that tanx = x + x³/3 + 2x⁵/15 + ... So tan²x = (x + x³/3 + ...)² = x² + 2x⁴/3 + (2x⁶)/15 + ... So tan²x ≈ x² + (2/3)x⁴. Therefore, the numerator x² - tan²x ≈ x² - (x² + (2/3)x⁴) = - (2/3)x⁴.\n\nThe denominator x² tan²x ≈ x²*(x² + (2/3)x⁴) ≈ x⁴ + (2/3)x⁶ ≈ x⁴.\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes (-2/3 x⁴)/x⁴ = -2/3. Therefore, the limit is -2/3. That seems to confirm my initial thought.\n\nBut let me try another method without Taylor series, in case I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, write everything in terms of sin and cos. Since tanx = sinx/cosx, so 1/tan²x = cos²x/sin²x. Therefore, the expression becomes:\n\ncos²x/sin²x - 1/x² = (cos²x - sin²x/x²)/sin²x\n\nWait, but maybe that's not helpful. Let's see. Alternatively, combine the terms as before:\n\n( x² - tan²x ) / ( x² tan²x )\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator separately.\n\nFirst, numerator: x² - tan²x. Let me factor that as - (tanx - x)(tanx + x). Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, express tanx in terms of sin and cos: tanx = sinx/cosx. So tan²x = sin²x/cos²x. Therefore, numerator:\n\nx² - sin²x/cos²x = [x² cos²x - sin²x]/cos²x\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n[ x² cos²x - sin²x ] / [ cos²x * x² tan²x ]\n\nHmm, complicated. Let me see. The denominator is x² tan²x cos²x. tan²x is sin²x/cos²x, so denominator is x² * sin²x/cos²x * cos²x = x² sin²x. So denominator simplifies to x² sin²x.\n\nTherefore, the expression is [x² cos²x - sin²x] / [x² sin²x]\n\nSo that's the numerator x² cos²x - sin²x over x² sin²x.\n\nNow, let's split this fraction into two terms:\n\n[ x² cos²x / (x² sin²x) ) ] - [ sin²x / (x² sin²x) ] = [ cos²x / sin²x ] - [ 1 / x² ]\n\nWait, but that's the original expression. So that didn't help. Maybe I need to manipulate the numerator: x² cos²x - sin²x.\n\nAlternatively, factor out sin²x:\n\nx² cos²x - sin²x = sin²x ( x² cos²x / sin²x - 1 )\n\nBut x² cos²x / sin²x = (x/sinx)^2 cos²x. As x approaches 0, sinx ~ x, so x/sinx ~ 1, so (x/sinx)^2 ~1, and cos²x ~1 - x². So this would be approximately (1 - x²) - 1 = -x². Then multiplied by sin²x, which is ~x². So the numerator would be ~ -x² * x² = -x⁴, and denominator is x² sin²x ~x⁴. So again, -x⁴ /x⁴ ~ -1. But this seems similar to the previous approach, but getting -1 instead of -2/3. Wait, that contradicts. So probably this approach is too rough.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to expand numerator and denominator using Taylor series more carefully.\n\nLet me try expanding the numerator x² cos²x - sin²x.\n\nFirst, expand cosx: cosx = 1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24 - ...\n\nSo cos²x = (1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24)^2 = 1 - x² + (2x⁴)/3 + ... (Wait, let me compute that correctly. (1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24)^2. Using (a + b + c)^2 = a² + 2ab + 2ac + b² + 2bc + c². So here, a=1, b=-x²/2, c=x⁴/24. Then a²=1, 2ab=2*1*(-x²/2)= -x², 2ac=2*1*(x⁴/24)=x⁴/12, b²=(x⁴)/4, 2bc=2*(-x²/2)(x⁴/24)= -x⁶/24, c²=x⁸/576. So up to x⁴ terms, cos²x = 1 - x² + (x⁴/12 + x⁴/4) = 1 - x² + ( (1/12 + 3/12 )x⁴ ) = 1 - x² + (4/12)x⁴ = 1 - x² + x⁴/3. So cos²x ≈ 1 - x² + x⁴/3.\n\nThen x² cos²x ≈ x² (1 - x² + x⁴/3 ) = x² - x⁴ + x⁶/3.\n\nNow, expand sinx: sinx = x - x³/6 + x⁵/120 - ..., so sin²x = (x - x³/6 + ...)^2 = x² - x⁴/3 + 2x⁶/45 + ... Therefore, sin²x ≈ x² - x⁴/3.\n\nTherefore, numerator x² cos²x - sin²x ≈ (x² - x⁴ + x⁶/3) - (x² - x⁴/3) = x² - x⁴ + x⁶/3 - x² + x⁴/3 = (-x⁴ + x⁴/3) + x⁶/3 = (-2x⁴/3) + x⁶/3.\n\nSo the numerator is approximately -2x⁴/3 + higher order terms.\n\nThe denominator is x² sin²x ≈ x² (x² - x⁴/3) = x⁴ - x⁶/3.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes ( -2x⁴/3 + ... ) / (x⁴ - x⁶/3 ) ≈ (-2x⁴/3)/x⁴ = -2/3 as x approaches 0. So that confirms again the limit is -2/3.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: use L’Hospital’s Rule. Let's see. Let me try that. Let's write the original expression as:\n\nlim_{x→0} [1/tan²x - 1/x²] = lim_{x→0} [cot²x - 1/x²]. Let me write it as [cotx - 1/x][cotx + 1/x]. But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, considering the expression as [x² - tan²x]/[x² tan²x]. Let me call this f(x)/g(x), where f(x) = x² - tan²x, g(x) = x² tan²x.\n\nAs x→0, f(x)→0 and g(x)→0. So we can apply L’Hospital’s Rule, which says lim f/g = lim f’/g’ provided that limit exists. Let's compute derivatives.\n\nFirst, f(x) = x² - tan²x. Then f’(x) = 2x - 2 tanx sec²x.\n\ng(x) = x² tan²x. Then g’(x) = 2x tan²x + x² * 2 tanx sec²x = 2x tan²x + 2x² tanx sec²x.\n\nSo now, the limit becomes lim_{x→0} [2x - 2 tanx sec²x] / [2x tan²x + 2x² tanx sec²x].\n\nHmm, still looks complicated. Let's evaluate numerator and denominator as x→0.\n\nFirst, numerator: 2x - 2 tanx sec²x. Let's approximate each term. tanx ~ x + x³/3, sec²x = 1 + tan²x ~ 1 + x². Therefore, tanx sec²x ~ (x + x³/3)(1 + x²) ≈ x + x³ + x³/3 ≈ x + (4/3)x³. Multiply by 2: 2x + (8/3)x³. So the numerator 2x - 2 tanx sec²x ≈ 2x - [2x + (8/3)x³] = - (8/3)x³.\n\nDenominator: 2x tan²x + 2x² tanx sec²x. Let's approximate each term. tan²x ~ x² + (2/3)x⁴, so 2x tan²x ~ 2x*(x²) = 2x³. Then tanx ~x, sec²x ~1 + x², so 2x² tanx sec²x ~2x²*x*(1 + x²) ≈2x³. Therefore, denominator ≈2x³ + 2x³ =4x³.\n\nSo the expression becomes (-8/3 x³)/4x³ = (-8/3)/4 = -2/3. So again, the same result. So even using L’Hospital once, with approximations, we get the result. But perhaps to be rigorous, we might need to apply L’Hospital multiple times? Let me check.\n\nWait, after the first derivative, we have:\n\nNumerator: 2x - 2 tanx sec²x\n\nDenominator: 2x tan²x + 2x² tanx sec²x\n\nIf I plug x=0 directly into numerator and denominator, we get 0 - 0 = 0 in numerator and 0 + 0 = 0 in denominator. So it's still 0/0. So we need to apply L’Hospital again. Let's compute the second derivative.\n\nFirst, find f’’(x) and g’’(x):\n\nf’(x) = 2x - 2 tanx sec²x\n\nf’’(x) = 2 - 2 [ d/dx (tanx sec²x) ]\n\nLet me compute derivative of tanx sec²x. Let’s denote u = tanx, v = sec²x. Then d/dx (uv) = u’v + uv’.\n\nWe know that u’ = sec²x, v’ = 2 sec²x tanx.\n\nTherefore, derivative is sec²x * sec²x + tanx * 2 sec²x tanx = sec⁴x + 2 tan²x sec²x.\n\nTherefore, f’’(x) = 2 - 2[sec⁴x + 2 tan²x sec²x] = 2 - 2 sec⁴x - 4 tan²x sec²x.\n\nNow, g’(x) = 2x tan²x + 2x² tanx sec²x\n\nCompute g’’(x):\n\nFirst term: d/dx [2x tan²x] = 2 tan²x + 2x * 2 tanx sec²x = 2 tan²x + 4x tanx sec²x\n\nSecond term: d/dx [2x² tanx sec²x] = 4x tanx sec²x + 2x² [ d/dx (tanx sec²x) ]\n\nWe already computed d/dx (tanx sec²x) above as sec⁴x + 2 tan²x sec²x.\n\nTherefore, second term derivative: 4x tanx sec²x + 2x² [ sec⁴x + 2 tan²x sec²x ]\n\nSo overall, g’’(x) = 2 tan²x + 4x tanx sec²x + 4x tanx sec²x + 2x² sec⁴x + 4x² tan²x sec²x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= 2 tan²x + 8x tanx sec²x + 2x² sec⁴x + 4x² tan²x sec²x\n\nNow, evaluating f’’(x) and g’’(x) as x→0:\n\nFirst, compute f’’(x):\n\n= 2 - 2 sec⁴x - 4 tan²x sec²x\n\nsecx = 1/cosx ~1 + x²/2 as x→0. So sec⁴x ~ (1 + x²/2)^4 ≈1 + 2x² + ... Similarly, tan²x ~x², sec²x ~1 + x². So tan²x sec²x ~x²(1 + x²) ~x². Therefore, f’’(x) ≈2 - 2(1 + 2x²) -4x²(1 + x²) ≈2 - 2 -4x² -4x² ≈-8x². So f’’(x) ~-8x².\n\ng’’(x):\n\n= 2 tan²x + 8x tanx sec²x + 2x² sec⁴x + 4x² tan²x sec²x\n\ntan²x ~x², tanx ~x, sec²x ~1, sec⁴x ~1. So:\n\n≈2x² + 8x*x*1 + 2x²*1 + 4x²*x²*1 ≈2x² +8x² +2x² +4x⁴≈12x² +4x⁴≈12x².\n\nTherefore, f’’(x)/g’’(x) ≈(-8x²)/12x²≈-8/12 = -2/3. Therefore, lim_{x→0} f’’(x)/g’’(x)= -2/3. Therefore, after applying L’Hospital twice, we get the limit as -2/3.\n\nTherefore, the original limit is indeed -2/3.\n\nAlternatively, another method: using trigonometric identities. Let me think.\n\nWe can write 1/tan²x = cot²x = csc²x -1. Therefore, the expression becomes (csc²x -1) -1/x² = csc²x -1 -1/x². But csc²x = 1 + cot²x, which doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, recall that csc²x = 1/sin²x. So the expression is 1/sin²x -1 -1/x². Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's express everything in terms of sinx and cosx:\n\nOriginal expression: 1/tan²x -1/x² = cot²x -1/x² = cos²x/sin²x -1/x².\n\nCombine them over a common denominator:\n\n( x² cos²x - sin²x ) / (x² sin²x )\n\nNow, to compute this limit, perhaps multiply numerator and denominator by something? Let me consider expanding the numerator:\n\nx² cos²x - sin²x = x²(1 - sin²x) - sin²x = x² - x² sin²x - sin²x = x² - sin²x(1 + x²)\n\nBut not sure if that helps. Alternatively, expand sin²x as x² - x⁴/3 + ... So let me do that.\n\nsin²x = x² - x⁴/3 + 2x⁶/15 - ...\n\nTherefore, numerator x² cos²x - sin²x.\n\nWe already found earlier that x² cos²x ≈x² -x⁴ +x⁶/3, and sin²x≈x² -x⁴/3. Therefore, subtracting gives x² -x⁴ +x⁶/3 - (x² -x⁴/3) = -2x⁴/3 +x⁶/3 as before. Therefore, leading term -2x⁴/3, denominator x² sin²x≈x²*(x²) =x⁴. Therefore, ratio is -2/3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the limit lim_{x→0} (1/x² - 1/sin²x) which is known to be 1/3. Wait, is that correct? Wait, let me check. Suppose we compute lim_{x→0} (1/sin²x -1/x²). Let me compute that.\n\nLet’s compute lim_{x→0} (1/sin²x -1/x²). Combining terms:\n\n(x² - sin²x)/(x² sin²x). Then, numerator x² - sin²x ≈x² - (x² -x⁴/3)=x⁴/3. Denominator≈x²*x²=x⁴. Therefore, the limit is (x⁴/3)/x⁴=1/3. Therefore, lim_{x→0} (1/sin²x -1/x²)=1/3.\n\nTherefore, if that's the case, then our original problem is lim (cot²x -1/x²)= lim ( (cos²x/sin²x) -1/x² ) = lim ( cos²x/sin²x -1/x² ) = lim [ (cos²x -1)/sin²x + (1/sin²x -1/x²) ].\n\nWait, cos²x -1 = -sin²x, so:\n\n= lim [ -sin²x/sin²x + (1/sin²x -1/x²) ] = lim [ -1 + (1/sin²x -1/x²) ] = -1 + 1/3 = -2/3. That's another way to compute it, using the known limit of (1/sin²x -1/x²)=1/3. Therefore, subtracting 1 gives -2/3. Clever!\n\nSo that's another approach. So using that known limit, we can split the expression into two parts.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the limit is -2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-\\dfrac{2}{3}}\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\tan^2 x} - \\dfrac{1}{x^2} \\right)\\), we can use several methods. Here, we use the Taylor series expansion approach and trigonometric identities.\n\nFirst, we rewrite the expression as a single fraction:\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tan^2 x} - \\frac{1}{x^2} \\right) = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{x^2 - \\tan^2 x}{x^2 \\tan^2 x}\n\\]\n\nNext, we expand \\(\\tan x\\) and \\(\\sin x\\) using their Taylor series around 0:\n\\[\n\\tan x = x + \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{2x^5}{15} + \\cdots \\implies \\tan^2 x = x^2 + \\frac{2x^4}{3} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sin x = x - \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\frac{x^5}{120} - \\cdots \\implies \\sin^2 x = x^2 - \\frac{x^4}{3} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nUsing these expansions, we approximate the numerator and denominator:\n\\[\nx^2 - \\tan^2 x \\approx x^2 - \\left( x^2 + \\frac{2x^4}{3} \\right) = -\\frac{2x^4}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 \\tan^2 x \\approx x^2 \\left( x^2 + \\frac{2x^4}{3} \\right) \\approx x^4\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{-\\frac{2x^4}{3}}{x^4} = -\\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nWe can also verify this using trigonometric identities and known limits.

      "r1_solution_2": "Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of (1/tan²x - 1/x²). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Limits involving trigonometric functions can sometimes be tricky, especially when they involve subtraction. Maybe I can rewrite tan x in terms of sin and cos to make it easier? Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I know that tan x = sin x / cos x, so tan²x = sin²x / cos²x. Therefore, 1/tan²x is cos²x / sin²x. So the expression becomes (cos²x / sin²x) - (1/x²). Hmm, maybe I can combine these two terms into a single fraction? That might help simplify things.\n\nTo combine them, I need a common denominator. The denominators are sin²x and x², so the common denominator would be x² sin²x. Let's rewrite each term:\n\nFirst term: (cos²x / sin²x) = (cos²x * x²) / (x² sin²x)\nSecond term: (1/x²) = (sin²x) / (x² sin²x)\n\nSo subtracting them gives [cos²x * x² - sin²x] / (x² sin²x). Hmm, okay. So the numerator is x² cos²x - sin²x, and the denominator is x² sin²x.\n\nNow, as x approaches 0, both the numerator and the denominator approach 0. Because sin x ~ x and cos x ~ 1 - x²/2 for small x. So plugging in x=0, numerator becomes 0 - 0 = 0 and denominator becomes 0. So it's 0/0 indeterminate form. That means I can apply L'Hospital's Rule here. Wait, but L'Hospital's Rule applies to limits of the form 0/0 or ∞/∞. So since both numerator and denominator approach 0, yes, I can apply L'Hospital's Rule. But wait, L'Hospital's Rule is for a ratio, so maybe I need to take derivatives of numerator and denominator separately?\n\nAlternatively, maybe expanding sin x and cos x as Taylor series around 0 would help. Let me try that.\n\nRecall that sin x = x - x³/6 + x⁵/120 - ... and cos x = 1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24 - ... So let's compute the numerator and denominator up to some order.\n\nFirst, cos²x: (1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24 - ...)^2 = 1 - x² + (x⁴/3) + higher terms. Wait, let me square it properly. (1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24)^2 = 1 - x² + (x⁴/3) + ...? Let me check:\n\n(1 + a + b)^2 where a = -x²/2, b = x⁴/24. Then expanding, we get 1 + 2a + (2b + a²). So 2a = -x², and 2b + a² = 2*(x⁴/24) + (x^4)/4 = (x⁴/12) + (x^4)/4 = (x⁴/12 + 3x⁴/12) = 4x⁴/12 = x⁴/3. So cos²x ≈ 1 - x² + x⁴/3.\n\nSimilarly, sin²x: (x - x³/6 + x⁵/120)^2 = x² - (x^4)/3 + (2x^6)/15 + ... Let's verify:\n\n(x - x³/6)^2 = x² - 2*(x)*(x³/6) + (x³/6)^2 = x² - x^4/3 + x^6/36. So up to x^4 term, it's x² - x^4/3.\n\nSo the numerator is x² cos²x - sin²x. Let's compute x² cos²x: x²*(1 - x² + x⁴/3) = x² - x^4 + x^6/3. Then subtract sin²x (which is x² - x^4/3 + ...). So:\n\nx² cos²x - sin²x = (x² - x^4 + x^6/3) - (x² - x^4/3 + x^6/36) = x² - x^4 + x^6/3 - x² + x^4/3 - x^6/36. Let's simplify term by term:\n\nx² - x² = 0\n\n- x^4 + x^4/3 = (-3x^4/3 + x^4/3) = -2x^4/3\n\nx^6/3 - x^6/36 = (12x^6/36 - x^6/36) = 11x^6/36\n\nSo up to x^6 terms, the numerator is -2x^4/3 + 11x^6/36 + ... So the numerator is approximately -2x^4/3 when x is near 0.\n\nNow, the denominator is x² sin²x. Let's compute that. sin²x ≈ x² - x^4/3, so x² sin²x ≈ x²*(x² - x^4/3) = x^4 - x^6/3.\n\nTherefore, the denominator is approximately x^4 - x^6/3.\n\nSo putting numerator over denominator:\n\n(-2x^4/3 + 11x^6/36) / (x^4 - x^6/3) ≈ (-2/3 x^4) / (x^4) ) = -2/3, when x approaches 0. But wait, there are higher-order terms. Let's factor out x^4 from numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: x^4*(-2/3 + 11x²/36)\n\nDenominator: x^4*(1 - x²/3)\n\nSo the x^4 cancels, and we get (-2/3 + 11x²/36) / (1 - x²/3). Now, taking the limit as x approaches 0, the x² terms go to 0, so this becomes (-2/3) / 1 = -2/3.\n\nTherefore, the limit is -2/3.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the expansion. Let's re-examine the numerator: x² cos²x - sin²x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of expanding, there's another approach. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, use L’Hospital’s Rule. The original expression is (1/tan²x - 1/x²). Let me write this as (x² - tan²x)/(x² tan²x). Because 1/tan²x -1/x² = (x² - tan²x)/(x² tan²x). Let's verify:\n\n1/tan²x -1/x² = (x² - tan²x)/(x² tan²x). Yes, because common denominator is x² tan²x, so numerator is x² - tan²x.\n\nTherefore, the expression becomes (x² - tan²x)/(x² tan²x). Now, as x approaches 0, both numerator and denominator approach 0. So apply L’Hospital’s Rule. But since it's 0/0, we can take derivatives of numerator and denominator. However, since both numerator and denominator approach 0, we can apply L’Hospital’s multiple times if needed.\n\nBut taking derivatives might get complicated. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let’s denote N(x) = x² - tan²x and D(x) = x² tan²x.\n\nCompute N’(x) and D’(x):\n\nN’(x) = 2x - 2 tan x sec²x\n\nD’(x) = 2x tan²x + x² * 2 tan x sec²x\n\nSo the new expression after first derivative is [2x - 2 tan x sec²x] / [2x tan²x + 2x² tan x sec²x]\n\nNow, plugging x=0 into this: numerator becomes 0 - 0 = 0, denominator becomes 0 + 0 = 0. So still 0/0. Apply L’Hospital’s again.\n\nCompute N’’(x) and D’’(x):\n\nFirst, N’(x) = 2x - 2 tan x sec²x\n\nN’’(x) = 2 - 2 [sec²x * sec²x + tan x * 2 sec²x tan x] (using product rule on the second term). Let me verify:\n\nDerivative of tan x sec²x: Let me write tan x sec²x as tan x * sec²x. Let u = tan x, v = sec²x. Then d/dx (uv) = u’v + uv’.\n\nu’ = sec²x, v’ = 2 sec²x tan x.\n\nSo derivative is sec²x * sec²x + tan x * 2 sec²x tan x = sec⁴x + 2 tan²x sec²x.\n\nTherefore, N’’(x) = 2 - 2 [sec⁴x + 2 tan²x sec²x] = 2 - 2 sec⁴x - 4 tan²x sec²x.\n\nSimilarly, D’(x) = 2x tan²x + 2x² tan x sec²x\n\nCompute D’’(x):\n\nFirst term: derivative of 2x tan²x. Let’s use product rule: 2 tan²x + 2x * 2 tan x sec²x = 2 tan²x + 4x tan x sec²x.\n\nSecond term: derivative of 2x² tan x sec²x. Let’s denote u = 2x², v = tan x sec²x. Then derivative is u’v + uv’.\n\nu’ = 4x\n\nv’ = derivative of tan x sec²x, which we computed earlier as sec⁴x + 2 tan²x sec²x.\n\nSo the second term derivative is 4x tan x sec²x + 2x² [sec⁴x + 2 tan²x sec²x]\n\nTherefore, D’’(x) = [2 tan²x + 4x tan x sec²x] + [4x tan x sec²x + 2x² sec⁴x + 4x² tan²x sec²x]\n\nSimplify:\n\n2 tan²x + 4x tan x sec²x + 4x tan x sec²x + 2x² sec⁴x + 4x² tan²x sec²x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2 tan²x + 8x tan x sec²x + 2x² sec⁴x + 4x² tan²x sec²x\n\nNow, evaluating N’’(x) and D’’(x) as x approaches 0.\n\nFirst, N’’(x) = 2 - 2 sec⁴x - 4 tan²x sec²x\n\nAt x=0, sec x = 1, tan x = 0. So plugging in x=0:\n\nN’’(0) = 2 - 2*1 - 4*0 = 2 - 2 = 0\n\nSimilarly, D’’(x) evaluated at x=0:\n\n2 tan²0 + 8*0*tan 0 sec²0 + 2*0² sec⁴0 + 4*0² tan²0 sec²0 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n\nStill 0/0. So need to apply L’Hospital’s again. This is getting complicated. Maybe a third derivative?\n\nBut this seems tedious. Perhaps the Taylor series approach was better. Let me go back to that.\n\nEarlier, using Taylor series, I found that the numerator is approximately -2x^4/3 and the denominator is approximately x^4, so the ratio is -2/3. Therefore, the limit is -2/3.\n\nAlternatively, let me verify with another method. Let's write the original expression as (1/tan²x - 1/x²) = (1/(sin²x/cos²x) - 1/x²) = (cos²x/sin²x - 1/x²) = (cos²x/x² sin²x - 1/x²) = (cos²x - sin²x)/x² sin²x. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait:\n\nWait, cos²x / sin²x - 1/x² = [cos²x - sin²x/x²] / sin²x? Wait, no. Wait, hold on.\n\nWait, if we have (cos²x/sin²x - 1/x²), to combine over common denominator:\n\n= [cos²x * x² - sin²x] / (x² sin²x). Which is what I had earlier.\n\nSo that's the same as [x² cos²x - sin²x] / (x² sin²x). Let's factor the numerator.\n\nBut maybe factor sin²x out?\n\nWait, x² cos²x - sin²x = x²(1 - sin²x) - sin²x = x² - x² sin²x - sin²x = x² - sin²x (x² +1). Hmm, not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of sin x.\n\nLet me set t = x. So as x approaches 0, t approaches 0. Let me write the expression as [1/tan²t - 1/t²]. Let me express tan t as sin t / cos t, so 1/tan²t = cos²t / sin²t. Therefore, the expression becomes cos²t / sin²t - 1/t² = [cos²t * t² - sin²t] / (t² sin²t).\n\nNow, let me write cos²t as 1 - sin²t. Then numerator becomes (1 - sin²t) t² - sin²t = t² - t² sin²t - sin²t. So, t² - sin²t (t² +1). Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express numerator as t² cos²t - sin²t. Let me factor this expression. Maybe use trigonometric identities.\n\nWait, t² cos²t - sin²t. Hmm, not obvious. Maybe write sin²t as 1 - cos²t. Wait, no, sin²t = 1 - cos²t. Then numerator becomes t² cos²t - (1 - cos²t) = t² cos²t -1 + cos²t = cos²t(t² +1 ) -1. Hmm, still not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use series expansions. Let's do that again, carefully.\n\nFirst, cos t ≈ 1 - t²/2 + t⁴/24 - ..., so cos²t ≈ (1 - t²/2)^2 = 1 - t² + (t^4)/4. Wait, earlier I had a different coefficient for t^4. Wait, let's compute cos²t:\n\ncos t = 1 - t²/2 + t^4/24 - t^6/720 + ..., so squaring:\n\ncos²t = (1 - t²/2 + t^4/24)^2 = 1 - t² + (t^4)/3 - (t^6)/12 + ... Hmm, conflicting with previous thought. Wait, let me compute it step by step.\n\n(1 - t²/2 + t^4/24)^2:\n\nFirst, square the first two terms: (1 - t²/2)^2 = 1 - t² + t^4/4.\n\nThen, cross terms: 2*(1)*(t^4/24) = t^4/12.\n\nSo cos²t ≈ 1 - t² + t^4/4 + t^4/12 = 1 - t² + (3t^4 + t^4)/12 = 1 - t² + t^4/3.\n\nAh, so cos²t ≈ 1 - t² + t^4/3. So earlier step was correct.\n\nSimilarly, sin t ≈ t - t^3/6 + t^5/120 - ..., so sin²t ≈ t² - t^4/3 + 2t^6/45. Let me confirm:\n\n(t - t^3/6)^2 = t² - 2*t*(t^3/6) + (t^3/6)^2 = t² - t^4/3 + t^6/36. So up to t^4 terms, sin²t ≈ t² - t^4/3.\n\nSo, the numerator is t² cos²t - sin²t ≈ t²(1 - t² + t^4/3) - (t² - t^4/3) = t² - t^4 + t^6/3 - t² + t^4/3 = (-t^4 + t^4/3) + t^6/3 = (-2t^4/3) + t^6/3. So numerator ≈ -2t^4/3 + t^6/3.\n\nDenominator is t² sin²t ≈ t²*(t² - t^4/3) = t^4 - t^6/3.\n\nSo the ratio becomes (-2t^4/3 + t^6/3) / (t^4 - t^6/3). Factor out t^4 from numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: t^4*(-2/3 + t²/3)\n\nDenominator: t^4*(1 - t²/3)\n\nCancel t^4:\n\n(-2/3 + t²/3)/(1 - t²/3). Now, as t approaches 0, the t² terms vanish, so the limit is (-2/3)/1 = -2/3.\n\nTherefore, the limit is -2/3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use L’Hospital’s Rule more effectively. Let's try again.\n\nOriginal limit: lim_{x→0} (1/tan²x - 1/x²) = lim_{x→0} (x² - tan²x)/(x² tan²x). Let me denote this as N(x)/D(x).\n\nN(x) = x² - tan²x, D(x) = x² tan²x.\n\nFirst, check N(0) = 0 - 0 = 0, D(0) = 0. Apply L’Hospital’s.\n\nN’(x) = 2x - 2 tan x sec²x\n\nD’(x) = 2x tan²x + x² * 2 tan x sec²x\n\nSo lim_{x→0} N’(x)/D’(x). Plug x=0:\n\nN’(0) = 0 - 0 = 0\n\nD’(0) = 0 + 0 = 0. Apply L’Hospital’s again.\n\nN’’(x) = 2 - 2[sec^4x + 2 tan²x sec²x] (from earlier)\n\nD’’(x) = 2 tan²x + 8x tan x sec²x + 2x² sec^4x + 4x² tan²x sec²x\n\nEvaluate at x=0:\n\nN’’(0) = 2 - 2[1 + 0] = 2 - 2 = 0\n\nD’’(0) = 2*0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. Still 0/0. Apply L’Hospital’s once more.\n\nCompute N’’’(x) and D’’’(x):\n\nFirst, N’’(x) = 2 - 2 sec^4x - 4 tan²x sec²x\n\nN’’’(x) = -2*4 sec^4x tan x - 4[2 tan x sec²x * sec²x + tan²x * 2 sec²x tan x]\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Let me instead use the series expansions for N(x)/D(x). Since we already did Taylor series and found the limit is -2/3, maybe that's the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, another approach. Let me consider that 1/tan²x -1/x² = (cot²x - 1/x²). We can use the identity cot²x = (csc²x -1). So,\n\ncot²x -1/x² = csc²x -1 -1/x². Hmm, csc²x is 1/sin²x. So,\n\n= 1/sin²x -1 -1/x². Therefore, the expression becomes [1/sin²x -1 -1/x²]. But this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's write everything in terms of sin x and x:\n\nOriginal expression: [1/tan²x -1/x²] = [cos²x / sin²x -1/x²] = [cos²x - (sin²x)/x²] / sin²x. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\n[cos²x / sin²x -1/x²] = [cos²x * x² - sin²x] / (x² sin²x). Which is the same as before. So not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe multiply numerator and denominator by something. Let's see.\n\nOur expression is [cos²x / sin²x -1/x²] = [x² cos²x - sin²x]/(x² sin²x). Let me multiply numerator and denominator by x² to get [x² cos²x - sin²x]/(x^4 sin²x). Wait, no, that would be [x² cos²x - sin²x]/(x² sin²x). Maybe use known limits.\n\nRecall that lim_{x→0} (x - sin x)/x^3 = 1/6. Similarly, lim_{x→0} (sin x - x)/x^3 = -1/6. Maybe related?\n\nBut here we have x² cos²x - sin²x. Let me see.\n\nx² cos²x - sin²x = x² (1 - sin²x) - sin²x = x² - x² sin²x - sin²x = x² - sin²x (x² +1). Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, factor sin²x:\n\n= x² - sin²x (x² +1). Then, [x² - sin²x (x² +1)] / (x² sin²x) = [x² - sin²x - x² sin²x]/(x² sin²x).\n\nHmm, split into two terms:\n\n= [x² - sin²x]/(x² sin²x) - [x² sin²x]/(x² sin²x) = [x² - sin²x]/(x² sin²x) -1.\n\nSo the original limit becomes lim_{x→0} [ (x² - sin²x)/(x² sin²x) -1 ].\n\nSo compute lim_{x→0} (x² - sin²x)/(x² sin²x) first, then subtract 1.\n\nLet me compute (x² - sin²x)/(x² sin²x). Let's write this as [x - sinx][x + sinx]/(x² sin²x). Hmm, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, write as [x² - sin²x]/x^4 * x^4/(x² sin²x) = [x² - sin²x]/x^4 * x²/sin²x. Since x²/sin²x approaches 1 as x→0. So need to compute lim [x² - sin²x]/x^4.\n\nCompute [x² - sin²x]/x^4:\n\n= [x - sinx][x + sinx]/x^4 = [ (x - sinx)/x^3 ] * [x + sinx]/x.\n\nAs x→0, [x - sinx]/x^3 approaches 1/6 (with a negative sign?), wait:\n\nWait, lim_{x→0} (sinx - x)/x^3 = -1/6, so lim (x - sinx)/x^3 = 1/6. Hmm, no. Let's compute:\n\nsinx = x - x^3/6 + x^5/120 - ... so sinx - x = -x^3/6 + x^5/120 - ..., so (sinx -x)/x^3 = -1/6 + x²/120 - ..., so lim_{x→0} (sinx -x)/x^3 = -1/6. Therefore, lim_{x→0} (x - sinx)/x^3 = 1/6.\n\nTherefore, [x - sinx]/x^3 approaches 1/6 as x→0. Then, [x + sinx]/x = 1 + (sinx)/x, which approaches 1 +1 =2 as x→0. Therefore, the product is (1/6)*2 = 1/3. Therefore, lim [x² - sin²x]/x^4 = 1/3. Then, multiplying by lim x²/sin²x =1, so overall lim (x² - sin²x)/(x² sin²x) =1/3. Therefore, the original limit is 1/3 -1 = -2/3.\n\nYes! That works. So this gives the same result as the Taylor series. So the limit is -2/3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is -2/3, which in boxed form is \\boxed{-\\dfrac{2}{3}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-\\dfrac{2}{3}}\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\tan^2 x} - \\dfrac{1}{x^2} \\right)\\), we start by rewriting the expression in terms of sine and cosine:\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{1}{\\tan^2 x} - \\dfrac{1}{x^2} = \\dfrac{\\cos^2 x}{\\sin^2 x} - \\dfrac{1}{x^2}\n\\]\n\nCombining these terms into a single fraction, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{\\cos^2 x \\cdot x^2 - \\sin^2 x}{x^2 \\sin^2 x}\n\\]\n\nWe then use Taylor series expansions for \\(\\sin x\\) and \\(\\cos x\\) around \\(x = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin x \\approx x - \\dfrac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\cos x \\approx 1 - \\dfrac{x^2}{2} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nExpanding \\(\\sin^2 x\\) and \\(\\cos^2 x\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2 x \\approx x^2 - \\dfrac{x^4}{3} + \\cdots \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\cos^2 x \\approx 1 - x^2 + \\dfrac{x^4}{3} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the numerator and denominator:\n\n- Numerator: \\(x^2 \\cos^2 x - \\sin^2 x \\approx x^2 \\left(1 - x^2 + \\dfrac{x^4}{3}\\right) - \\left(x^2 - \\dfrac{x^4}{3}\\right)\\)\n\\[\n= x^2 - x^4 + \\dfrac{x^6}{3} - x^2 + \\dfrac{x^4}{3} = -\\dfrac{2x^4}{3} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\n- Denominator: \\(x^2 \\sin^2 x \\approx x^2 \\left(x^2 - \\dfrac{x^4}{3}\\right) = x^4 - \\dfrac{x^6}{3} + \\cdots\\)\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\dfrac{-\\dfrac{2x^4}{3}}{x^4} = -\\dfrac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the limit is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\dfrac{2}{3}}\n\\]",
      "r1_solution_3": "Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as x approaches 0 of (1/tan²x - 1/x²). Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that tanx is sinx/cosx, so tan²x would be sin²x/cos²x. Therefore, 1/tan²x is cos²x/sin²x. So the expression becomes cos²x/sin²x - 1/x². Maybe I can rewrite this as (cos²x - sin²x/x²) / sin²x. Wait, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe combine the two terms into a single fraction. Let's try that.\n\nSo, common denominator would be x² tan²x. But let me check. Let's see:\n\n1/tan²x - 1/x² = (x² - tan²x) / (x² tan²x). Yes, that's correct. So, combining the two fractions, the numerator becomes x² - tan²x, and the denominator is x² tan²x. Therefore, the limit is [x² - tan²x] / [x² tan²x] as x approaches 0.\n\nNow, when x approaches 0, both numerator and denominator approach 0. Let me verify. For the numerator, as x approaches 0, x² approaches 0, tanx approaches 0, so tan²x approaches 0. So numerator is 0 - 0 = 0. Denominator is x² tan²x, which is 0 * 0 = 0. So we have a 0/0 indeterminate form. Therefore, I can apply L'Hospital's Rule here. But wait, L'Hospital's Rule applies when we have a limit of the form f(x)/g(x) as x approaches a, and both f(x) and g(x) approach 0 or infinity. In this case, our expression is already a single fraction [0/0], so applying L'Hospital's might be possible, but the derivatives might get messy. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expand tanx using its Taylor series around 0. I remember that tanx = x + x³/3 + 2x⁵/15 + ... So tan²x would be (x + x³/3 + ... )². Let's square that. So tan²x = x² + (2x)(x³/3) + ... = x² + 2x⁴/3 + higher order terms. Wait, no, actually, (x + x³/3)^2 is x² + 2*(x)*(x³/3) + (x³/3)^2 = x² + (2x⁴)/3 + x⁶/9. So up to x⁴ term, it's x² + (2x⁴)/3. Therefore, tan²x ≈ x² + (2x⁴)/3 when x is near 0.\n\nSo then, the numerator x² - tan²x is x² - [x² + (2x⁴)/3 + ...] = - (2x⁴)/3 + higher order terms. So approximately, numerator is -2x⁴/3.\n\nDenominator is x² tan²x. Since tan²x ≈ x², the denominator is x² * x² = x⁴. So denominator ≈ x⁴. Therefore, the entire expression becomes (-2x⁴/3) / x⁴ = -2/3 as x approaches 0. Therefore, the limit should be -2/3. Hmm, that seems plausible.\n\nWait, let me check again. The numerator x² - tan²x ≈ x² - (x² + (2x⁴)/3) = - (2x⁴)/3. Denominator x² tan²x ≈ x² * x² = x⁴. So ratio is -2/3. So the limit is -2/3. Okay, that seems straightforward using series expansion. But maybe there's another way without using series expansion. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the expression as [1/tan²x - 1/x²] = [cot²x - 1/x²]. Hmm, cotx is cosx/sinx. So cot²x is cos²x/sin²x. Then, cot²x - 1/x² = [cos²x - sin²x/x²] / sin²x. Wait, not sure. Let me try to manipulate the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression: [1/tan²x - 1/x²] = [cot²x - 1/x²]. Let's write cotx as (cosx)/(sinx), so cot²x = cos²x/sin²x. Then, cot²x - 1/x² = (cos²x/sin²x) - 1/x². To combine these terms, let's get a common denominator, which would be x² sin²x. So:\n\n= [cos²x * x² - sin²x] / [x² sin²x]. Hmm, the numerator is x² cos²x - sin²x. Let's see. Maybe factor this numerator. Hmm, not sure. Let's expand cos²x as 1 - sin²x. So:\n\nx² (1 - sin²x) - sin²x = x² - x² sin²x - sin²x. So, x² - sin²x (x² + 1). Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's write the numerator as x² cos²x - sin²x. Let's factor sin²x:\n\nWait, x² cos²x - sin²x = x² (1 - sin²x) - sin²x = x² - x² sin²x - sin²x = x² - sin²x (x² + 1). Still not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express sinx in terms of its Taylor series. sinx = x - x³/6 + x⁵/120 - ..., so sin²x = x² - x⁴/3 + 2x⁶/15 + ... Similarly, cosx = 1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24 - ..., so cos²x = (1 - x²/2 + x⁴/24)^2 = 1 - x² + (x⁴/3) + ... So putting this into the numerator:\n\nx² cos²x - sin²x ≈ x² (1 - x² + x⁴/3) - (x² - x⁴/3 + ...) = x² - x⁴ + x⁶/3 - x² + x⁴/3 + ... = (-x⁴ + x⁴/3) + higher terms = (-2x⁴/3) + ... So numerator ≈ -2x⁴/3. Denominator is x² sin²x ≈ x² (x² - x⁴/3) ≈ x⁴. Therefore, the expression is (-2x⁴/3) / x⁴ = -2/3. So same result. So regardless of how I approach it, series expansion gives me -2/3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use L’Hospital’s Rule. Let's try that. Original limit:\n\nlim_{x→0} [ (x² - tan²x) / (x² tan²x) ]\n\nAs x approaches 0, both numerator and denominator approach 0, so applying L’Hospital’s Rule. But since this is a 0/0 form, take derivatives of numerator and denominator. However, L’Hospital’s Rule applies to the form f(x)/g(x), so here f(x) = x² - tan²x, g(x) = x² tan²x. Then f’(x) = 2x - 2 tanx sec²x, and g’(x) = 2x tan²x + x² * 2 tanx sec²x.\n\nSo applying L’Hospital once:\n\nlim_{x→0} [2x - 2 tanx sec²x] / [2x tan²x + 2x² tanx sec²x]\n\nHmm, evaluating this at x=0. Let's see. Numerator: 2*0 - 2*0*1 = 0. Denominator: 2*0*0 + 2*0²*0*1 = 0. So still 0/0. Apply L’Hospital again. So take derivative of numerator and denominator again.\n\nFirst, derivative of numerator:\n\nd/dx [2x - 2 tanx sec²x] = 2 - 2 [sec²x sec²x + tanx * 2 sec²x tanx] (using derivative of tanx sec²x). Wait, let me compute it step by step.\n\nLet me denote N = 2x - 2 tanx sec²x.\n\ndN/dx = 2 - 2 [ d/dx (tanx sec²x) ]\n\nUse product rule: d/dx(tanx sec²x) = sec²x * sec²x + tanx * 2 sec²x tanx.\n\nWait, derivative of tanx is sec²x, derivative of sec²x is 2 sec²x tanx. Wait, no. Wait, let me be precise.\n\nLet me let u = tanx, v = sec²x. Then d/dx(uv) = u’v + uv’.\n\nu’ = sec²x, v’ = 2 sec²x tanx. Therefore,\n\nd/dx(tanx sec²x) = sec²x * sec²x + tanx * 2 sec²x tanx = sec⁴x + 2 tan²x sec²x.\n\nTherefore, derivative of N is:\n\n2 - 2 [ sec⁴x + 2 tan²x sec²x ]\n\nSimilarly, derivative of denominator:\n\nDenominator D = 2x tan²x + 2x² tanx sec²x.\n\ndD/dx = 2 tan²x + 2x * 2 tanx sec²x + 4x tanx sec²x + 2x² [ derivative of tanx sec²x ]\n\nWait, let's compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: d/dx [2x tan²x] = 2 tan²x + 2x * 2 tanx sec²x = 2 tan²x + 4x tanx sec²x.\n\nSecond term: d/dx [2x² tanx sec²x] = 4x tanx sec²x + 2x² [ derivative of tanx sec²x ]\n\nAgain, derivative of tanx sec²x is sec⁴x + 2 tan²x sec²x as before. Therefore,\n\nd/dx [2x² tanx sec²x] = 4x tanx sec²x + 2x² (sec⁴x + 2 tan²x sec²x )\n\nSo putting together, derivative of denominator:\n\ndD/dx = 2 tan²x + 4x tanx sec²x + 4x tanx sec²x + 2x² sec⁴x + 4x² tan²x sec²x\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 2 tan²x + 8x tanx sec²x + 2x² sec⁴x + 4x² tan²x sec²x\n\nTherefore, after applying L’Hospital’s Rule twice, the limit becomes:\n\nlim_{x→0} [2 - 2(sec⁴x + 2 tan²x sec²x)] / [2 tan²x + 8x tanx sec²x + 2x² sec⁴x + 4x² tan²x sec²x]\n\nNow, evaluate as x approaches 0. Let's substitute x=0:\n\nNumerator:\n\n2 - 2(sec⁴0 + 2 tan²0 sec²0) = 2 - 2(1 + 0) = 2 - 2 = 0\n\nDenominator:\n\n2 tan²0 + 8*0*tan0 sec²0 + 2*0² sec⁴0 + 4*0² tan²0 sec²0 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n\nAgain 0/0. So we need to apply L’Hospital’s Rule a third time. This is getting complicated. Maybe there is a better way. But let me try once more.\n\nCompute the third derivative. But this seems really tedious. Maybe there is a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, let's go back to the original expression. The limit is [1/tan²x - 1/x²]. Let's rewrite tanx as sinx/cosx, so 1/tan²x is cos²x/sin²x. Then the expression becomes:\n\ncos²x/sin²x - 1/x² = (cos²x - sin²x/x²) / sin²x. Wait, but this is similar to what I did earlier. Alternatively, factor out 1/sin²x:\n\n= [cos²x - (sin²x)/x²] / sin²x = [cos²x - (sinx/x)²] / sin²x\n\nHmm, as x approaches 0, sinx/x approaches 1, so sinx/x squared approaches 1. So cos²x - 1 would be approaching cos²0 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0. So again, 0/0 form. Maybe use L’Hospital here? But the expression is a bit nested. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, use trigonometric identities. Let me recall that cos²x = 1 - sin²x. So substitute that in:\n\n[1 - sin²x - (sin²x)/x²] / sin²x = [1 - sin²x - sin²x/x²] / sin²x = [1 - sin²x(1 + 1/x²)] / sin²x. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, split the fraction:\n\n= cos²x/sin²x - 1/x² = (cos²x - (sin²x)/x²) / sin²x\n\nLet me write the numerator as cos²x - (sin²x)/x². Maybe factor sin²x:\n\n= [ (cos²x)/sin²x - 1/x² ] = [cot²x - 1/x² ]\n\nBut that's going in circles. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider multiplying numerator and denominator by x² to simplify. Wait, the original expression is [1/tan²x -1/x²] = [cot²x -1/x²]. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by x²:\n\n= [x² cot²x -1] / x²\n\nBut cotx = cosx/sinx, so cot²x = cos²x/sin²x. Therefore,\n\n= [x² cos²x / sin²x -1 ] / x² = [ (x² cos²x - sin²x)/sin²x ] / x² = (x² cos²x - sin²x) / (x² sin²x)\n\nWhich is back to where we started. So this approach isn't helping.\n\nAlternatively, use the identity tanx = x + x³/3 + 2x⁵/15 + ..., so tan²x = x² + 2x⁴/3 + 17x⁶/45 + ..., so 1/tan²x = 1/(x² + 2x⁴/3 + ...) = 1/x² * 1/(1 + 2x²/3 + ...) = 1/x² [1 - 2x²/3 + (2x²/3)^2 - ...] using the expansion 1/(1 + y) ≈ 1 - y + y² - ... for small y.\n\nTherefore, 1/tan²x ≈ 1/x² - 2/3 + (4x²)/9 - ... So subtracting 1/x² gives:\n\n1/tan²x -1/x² ≈ (1/x² - 2/3 + 4x²/9 - ...) -1/x² = -2/3 + 4x²/9 - ... So as x approaches 0, the limit is -2/3. Which matches the earlier result. So this method also gives the same answer.\n\nTherefore, it's pretty convincing that the limit is -2/3. Let me check another way for thoroughness.\n\nAnother approach: write the original expression as:\n\n1/tan²x -1/x² = (x² - tan²x)/(x² tan²x)\n\nWe can factor the numerator as (x - tanx)(x + tanx). So:\n\n= (x - tanx)(x + tanx) / (x² tan²x)\n\nNow, let's evaluate lim_{x→0} (x - tanx)/x³ and lim_{x→0} (x + tanx)/x. Because if we can write the expression as [(x - tanx)/x³] * [(x + tanx)/x] * [x^4 / (x² tan²x)].\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\n(x - tanx)(x + tanx) / (x² tan²x) = [ (x - tanx)/x³ ] * [ (x + tanx)/x ] * x^4 / (x² tan²x )\n\nBut x^4 / (x² tan²x ) = x² / tan²x. As x approaches 0, tanx ~ x, so x² / tan²x ~ x² / x² =1. Therefore, the limit would be [lim (x - tanx)/x³] * [lim (x + tanx)/x] *1.\n\nBut let's compute lim_{x→0} (x - tanx)/x³. Using series expansion: tanx = x + x³/3 + 2x⁵/15 +..., so x - tanx = -x³/3 -2x⁵/15 -... Therefore, (x - tanx)/x³ ≈ -1/3 - 2x²/15 -... So limit is -1/3.\n\nSimilarly, lim_{x→0} (x + tanx)/x = lim_{x→0} (x + x + x³/3 + ...)/x = lim (2x + x³/3 +...)/x = lim 2 + x²/3 + ... = 2.\n\nTherefore, the product would be (-1/3) * 2 = -2/3. Therefore, the limit is -2/3. So this method also confirms the result.\n\nTherefore, multiple methods: series expansion, factoring and using known limits, L’Hospital’s (though tedious), all lead to the same conclusion that the limit is -2/3.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and all approaches converge to the same answer. Therefore, the final answer is -2/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-\\dfrac{2}{3}}\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\left(\\dfrac{1}{\\tan^2 x} - \\dfrac{1}{x^2} \\right)\\), we start by combining the fractions into a single expression:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\left( \\frac{x^2 - \\tan^2 x}{x^2 \\tan^2 x} \\right)\n\\]\n\nBoth the numerator and the denominator approach 0 as \\(x \\to 0\\), leading to a 0/0 indeterminate form. We use the Taylor series expansion of \\(\\tan x\\) around 0. The Taylor series for \\(\\tan x\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\tan x = x + \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\frac{2x^5}{15} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nSquaring this series, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\tan^2 x = \\left( x + \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\cdots \\right)^2 = x^2 + \\frac{2x^4}{3} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the numerator \\(x^2 - \\tan^2 x\\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 - \\left( x^2 + \\frac{2x^4}{3} + \\cdots \\right) = -\\frac{2x^4}{3} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nThe denominator \\(x^2 \\tan^2 x\\) becomes:\n\n\\[\nx^2 \\left( x^2 + \\frac{2x^4}{3} + \\cdots \\right) = x^4 + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-\\frac{2x^4}{3}}{x^4} = -\\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\nThis result can also be confirmed by factoring the original expression and using known limits, or by applying L'Hospital's Rule multiple times, though the series expansion method is more straightforward here.\n\nTherefore, the limit is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-\\dfrac{2}{3}}\n\\]"
