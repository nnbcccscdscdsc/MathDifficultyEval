The pyramid is labeled SABCDEF, which means the base is a regular hexagon with vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, and the apex is S. The side length of the base is given as 2.\n\nThe problem states that a plane passes through vertex C and is parallel to two lines: the median BM of the lateral face SAB and the apothem SN of the lateral face SAF. Additionally, the distance from the apex S to this cutting plane is 1. I need to find the cosine of the angle between the plane of this cross-section and the plane of the base.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of a regular hexagonal pyramid. The base is a regular hexagon, so all sides are equal, and all internal angles are 120 degrees. The median BM in the face SAB would be the line from vertex B to the midpoint M of edge SA. Similarly, the apothem SN in the face SAF would be the line from vertex S to the midpoint N of edge AF.\n\nSince the cutting plane is parallel to both BM and SN, it must be parallel to the plane containing these two lines. However, the cutting plane itself passes through point C, so it's a specific plane that intersects the pyramid in such a way that it's parallel to BM and SN.\n\nTo solve this, I",

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the terms involved. A **discrete subgroup** of the group of isometries in Euclidean space refers to a subgroup where the group operation is discrete, meaning the elements are isolated points in the space. These subgroups are essentially groups of symmetries that are discrete, like the integer lattice in 2D or 3D space.\n\nAn **abelian subgroup** is a subgroup where the group operation is commutative. So, within the larger discrete subgroup, we're looking for a subgroup where every pair of elements commutes.\n\nThe **index** of a subgroup is the number of cosets of the subgroup within the larger group. So, we're looking for the smallest number of cosets that an abelian subgroup can have within a discrete subgroup of isometries.\n\nI recall that in Euclidean space, the group of isometries includes translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections. For a discrete subgroup, the translations form a normal subgroup, and the quotient group is a finite group of rotations and reflections.\n\nNow, focusing on abelian subgroups, the most straightforward abelian subgroups in the Euclidean isometry group are the translation subgroups.

A partition of \\( n \\) is a way of writing \\( n \\) as a sum of positive integers, where the order doesn't matter.
