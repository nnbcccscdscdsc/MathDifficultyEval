Also, the distance from the apex S to this cutting plane is 1. I need to find the cosine of the angle between the plane of the cross-section (created by the cutting plane) and the plane of the base.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the pyramid. It's a regular hexagonal pyramid, so the base is a regular hexagon, and all the lateral edges are equal. Each side of the base is 2 units long. The apex is S, and the base vertices are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in order.\n\nThe cutting plane passes through point C and is parallel to two lines: BM and SN. BM is the median of the face SAB, and SN is the apothem of the face SAF.\n\nI need to figure out the orientation of this cutting plane. Since it's parallel to BM and SN, it must be parallel to the directions of these two lines.

Hmm, that sounds a bit abstract, but let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let's recall what each term means. An isometry in Euclidean space is a transformation that preserves distances, like translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections. The group of all isometries in n-dimensional Euclidean space is denoted by E(n) or Iso(n). A discrete subgroup of this group means that the group has a discrete topology, so the points are isolated in some sense. Examples include crystallographic groups, which are used in describing symmetries of crystals.\n\nNow, an abelian subgroup is a subgroup where all elements commute. So, we're looking at a discrete subgroup Γ of Iso(n), and within Γ, there's an abelian subgroup H. The index of H in Γ, denoted [Γ : H], is the number of cosets of H in Γ. We want the best known bound on this index.\n\nI remember that in group theory, especially in the context of crystallographic groups, there are known results about the maximum possible order of finite subgroups or the structure of abelian subgroups. Maybe I can use some theorems from there.\n\nIn three dimensions, for example, the crystallographic groups (space groups) have been classified, and their ab",

The integrand is sin(x^n) / [x²(1 + x)]. I know that sin(x^n) oscillates between -1 and 1, but as n increases, x^n behaves differently depending on whether x is greater than 1 or less than 1. Since our integral is from 1 to n, and n is going to infinity, x is always greater than or equal to 1 in the interval of integration.\n\nWait, when x is greater than 1, x^n grows without bound as n increases. So, sin(x^n) will oscillate more and more rapidly as n increases. That makes me think about the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, which says that if you have an oscillatory function like sin(nx) integrated against a function that decays nicely, the integral tends to zero as n goes to infinity.

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky because of the absolute value. I remember that when dealing with absolute values in integrals, it's often helpful to split the region of integration into parts where the expression inside the absolute value is positive or negative. \n\nSo, the region we're dealing with is a square from (-1, -1) to (1, 1). The function inside the absolute value is x + y. I need to figure out where x + y is positive and where it's negative within this square. \n\nLet me visualize the square. The line x + y = 0 divides the square into two regions: one where x + y is positive and one where it's negative. This line is a diagonal from (-1, 1) to (1, -1). So, above this line, x + y is positive, and below it, x + y is negative. \n\nTherefore, I can split the integral into two parts: one over the region where x + y ≥ 0 and the other where x + y ≤ 0. Since the square is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis, and the function |x + y| is symmetric in a way, maybe I can exploit that symmetry to simplify the calculation.\n\nBut let me not get ahead of",
