A regular hexagonal pyramid has a base which is a regular hexagon with side length 2. The apex of the pyramid is point S, and there are six triangular faces connecting S to each side of the hexagon. \n\nNow, the problem says a plane passes through vertex C of the base ABCDEF and is parallel to two lines: the median BM of the lateral face SAB and the apothem SN of the lateral face SAF. We need to find the cosine of the angle between this cutting plane and the base.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of a regular hexagonal pyramid. All sides of the base are equal (each is 2 units), and all the lateral edges (like SA, SB, etc.) are congruent. The medians of the triangular faces (like BM in SAB) connect the midpoint of one edge to another specific point on the opposite edge, and the apothems are the slant heights of these triangular faces.\n\nSince the cutting plane is parallel to both BM and SN, it must be parallel to certain directions in the base. To understand this better, maybe I should assign coordinates to the vertices of the pyramid to make things more concrete.\n\nLet me place the base ABCDEF on the xy-plane for simplicity.

Discrete here means that the subgroup has no accumulation points; it's like points spread out without getting too close together.\n\n2. **Abelian Subgroup**: A subset of the discrete subgroup where all elements commute with each other. In simpler terms, if you take any two elements from this subgroup and multiply them (or compose them), the order doesn't matter.\n\n3. **Index**: The number of cosets of the abelian subgroup within the larger discrete subgroup. So, we're looking at how many different \"groups\" or \"shifts\" the abelian subgroup can produce when we partition the larger subgroup.\n\nThe question is asking for the best known bound on this index. From what I remember, there's something related to crystallographic groups in three-dimensional space. These are symmetry groups found in crystals, right?

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should clarify what exactly is meant by \"sum of natural numbers.\" Is it just any sequence of one or more natural numbers that add up to \\( n \\)? Or does it mean something else? Well, typically, when we talk about expressing \\( n \\) as a sum of natural numbers without specifying order, it usually refers to partitions of \\( n \\). A partition of \\( n \\) is a way of writing \\( n \\) as a sum of positive integers, where the order doesn't matter.

For values of x in [1, n], if x is greater than or equal to 1, then xⁿ will grow exponentially as n increases. So, for x > 1, sin(xⁿ) oscillates rapidly between -1 and 1. However, near x = 1, xⁿ doesn't change much since x is close to 1, but as x moves away from 1 towards larger values, the argument inside sine becomes more pronounced.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should think about substitution to make sense of this.
