The user mentioned something about a proof where the expression for \\( p^x \\) can't be an integer unless the denominator is 1. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst off, what exactly is an odd perfect number? Well, from what I remember, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and \\(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\\). Odd perfect numbers, on the other hand, have never been found; all known perfect numbers are even.\n\nNow, the question is about whether \\( p^x \\) can be an integer unless the denominator is 1.
