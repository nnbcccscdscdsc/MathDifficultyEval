A convex pentagon is a five-sided polygon where all interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and no sides curve inward. The question is asking about the number of distinct diagonals in such a shape. Diagonals are line segments connecting two non-adjacent vertices, right? So, in any polygon, a diagonal is a line connecting two vertices that aren't next to each other.\n\nOkay, so for a pentagon, which has five sides, how do we count these diagonals? Maybe I should start by visualizing a convex pentagon. Let me sketch it out mentally: five points labeled A, B, C, D, E connected in order to form the sides AB, BC, CD, DE, and EA.\n\nNow, to find the diagonals, I need to connect each vertex with every other vertex except its adjacent ones. That means from point A, I can draw lines to points C and D because connecting to B or E would just be the sides AB and AE, which aren't diagonals. Similarly, from point B, I can connect to D and E, but not to A or C. Wait, actually, hold on—connecting B to E isn't adjacent? In a pentagon, each",
