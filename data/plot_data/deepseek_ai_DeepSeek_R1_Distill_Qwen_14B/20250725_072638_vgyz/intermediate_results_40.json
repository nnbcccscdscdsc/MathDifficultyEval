More formally, \\( f \\geq \\liminf_{k \\to \\infty} f_k \\). But wait, actually, isn't epi-convergence defined in terms of both lim inf and lim sup?

But wait, the Master Theorem applies to divide-and-conquer recurrences of the form \\( T(n) = aT(n/b) + O(n^k) \\), right?

Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst off, what does it mean for a set to be dense in [0, 1]? A set is dense in an interval if every point in the interval is either in the set or is a limit point of the set. So, essentially, between any two points in [0, 1], no matter how close they are, there should be points from our set.\n\nNext, the set needs to be uncountable. That means its cardinality is greater than that of the natural numbers; it's as big as the real numbers in [0, 1]. But wait, the entire interval [0, 1] is uncountable, right? So we're looking for an uncountable subset of that which is also dense.\n\nNow, the tricky part is that this subset must have Lebesgue measure zero. Lebesgue measure zero means that, in some sense, the set is \"small\" in terms of length. For example, countable sets like the rationals in [0, 1] have measure zero because they can be covered by intervals with arbitrarily small total length.
