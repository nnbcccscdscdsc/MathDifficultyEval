When it's compact in the topological sense, it means that every open cover has a finite subcover. Metrizable means that the group can be equipped with a metric that induces its topology.

The statement says that if you run at a constant pace along any closed path, starting and ending at the same spot, and assuming the sun is stationary, you'll receive the same amount of sunlight on the front and back of your body.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. You're running in a loop, a closed path, which means you start and end at the same point. The sun is stationary, so its position doesn't change as you run. Now, the question is about whether the total sunlight hitting the front and back of your body would be the same during this run.\n\nI think I need to consider how sunlight interacts with your body as you move.

As you run around the path, your body's orientation relative to the sun changes depending on your direction of motion.\n\nLet's imagine you're running in a circular path. When you're facing directly towards the sun (let's say the sun is to your east), your front side is exposed to more sunlight because you're moving into the light. Conversely, when you're facing away from the sun (to the west), your back is exposed to less sunlight since you're moving away from the light source.\n\nBut wait, does the time spent facing each direction affect the total exposure?
