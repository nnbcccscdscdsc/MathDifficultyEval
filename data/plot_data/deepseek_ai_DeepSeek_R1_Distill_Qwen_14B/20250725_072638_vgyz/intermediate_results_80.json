That makes sense because uniform distribution means every point has an equal chance, so we're essentially comparing areas here.\n\nAlright, the square has sides from 0 to 2 on both the x and y axes.

A universal statement like \\( \\forall x\\,P(x) \\) means that every single element x has property P. On the other hand, an existential statement like \\( \\exists x\\,P(x) \\) just says that at least one element x has property P.

Now, when we say two subgroups are isomorphic, it means there exists a bijective (one-to-one and onto) homomorphism between them. In simpler terms, they have the same structure in terms of their algebraic properties.\n\nA normal subgroup is a special kind of subgroup where it remains unchanged under conjugation by any element of the main group.
