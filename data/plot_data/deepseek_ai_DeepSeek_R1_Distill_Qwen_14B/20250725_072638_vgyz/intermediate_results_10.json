Let me first understand what's given and what needs to be found.\n\nWe have a regular hexagonal pyramid labeled as SABCDEF. That means the base is a regular hexagon with vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, and the apex (the top point) is S. The side length of the base is 2. \n\nA plane passes through vertex C of the base and is parallel to two lines: the median BM of the lateral face SAB and the apothem SN of another lateral face SAF. Additionally, we're told that the distance from vertex S to this cutting plane is 1. We need to find the cosine of the angle between the plane of the cross-section (created by this cutting plane) and the plane of the base.\n\nOkay, let me break this down step by step.\n\n**Understanding the Pyramid Structure**\n\nFirst, since it's a regular hexagonal pyramid, all the edges from the apex S to each base vertex are equal in length. Also, the base is a regular hexagon, meaning all sides are equal, and all internal angles are 120 degrees. Each lateral face is an isosceles triangle because the pyramid is regular.\n\nThe base has six sides, each of length 2. So, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = 2.\n\n**Lateral Faces SAB and SAF",

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, let's make sure I understand all the terms here. An **isometry** in Euclidean space is a transformation that preserves distances. In other words, it's a map from the plane or some higher-dimensional space to itself where the distance between any two points remains unchanged after the transformation. Common examples include translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections.\n\nA **discrete subgroup** of the group of isometries means that if you take all these transformations and consider their compositions, the set of resulting transformations is discrete, meaning there are no accumulation points. So, intuitively, it's like having a set of symmetries where each symmetry is isolated; you can't have infinitely many of them piling up at a single point.\n\nNow, an **abelian subgroup** is a subgroup where every pair of elements commutes. That is, for any two elements \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in the subgroup, \\(ab = ba\\). Abelian groups are easier to handle because their structure is more straightforward compared to non-abelian groups.\n\nThe term **index** in group theory refers to the number of cosets when one group is embedded within another.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst off, when they say \"express the natural number \\( n \\) as a sum of natural numbers,\" I think they're talking about what's called partitions in mathematics. A partition of \\( n \\) is a way of writing \\( n \\) as a sum of positive integers, where the order doesn't matter.

For instance, with \\( n = 3 \\), the compositions would include things like \\( 1 + 2 \\) and \\( 2 + 1 \\), which are considered different from each other but the same in partitions.

Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst off, the integrand is sin(x^n)/(x²(1 + x)). As n grows larger, x^n behaves differently depending on the value of x. If x is greater than 1, then x^n will go to infinity as n increases. If x equals 1, x^n is always 1.

So for most of the interval, especially when x > 1, x^n is going to be very large, which means sin(x^n) oscillates rapidly because sine of a very large argument oscillates quickly between -1 and 1.\n\nI remember something about the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, which says that the integral of a rapidly oscillating function multiplied by an integrable function can tend to zero under certain conditions. Maybe that applies here?\n\nLet me recall the statement: If f is an L¹ function on [a, b], then the limit as k approaches infinity of the integral of f(k x) over [a, b]",
