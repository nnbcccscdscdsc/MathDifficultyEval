Hmm, let me start by recalling what these measures are.\n\nFirst off, a Riemannian manifold is a smooth manifold equipped with a Riemannian metric. This metric allows us to define lengths of tangent vectors, which in turn lets us measure distances between points and areas/volumes of subsets of the manifold. The Riemannian measure \\( \\mu \\) is essentially the \"volume\" measure on the manifold, assigning to each measurable set its volume according to this metric.\n\nOn the other hand, the Hausdorff measure \\( H^n \\) is defined using the Hausdorff dimension. For an \\( n \\)-dimensional manifold, the Hausdorff dimension is \\( n \\), and \\( H^n \\) assigns to each set its \\( n \\)-dimensional Hausdorff outer measure. Unlike the Riemannian measure, Hausdorff measure is defined purely in terms of the metric space structure without requiring any smoothness or differentiable structure.\n\nNow, I remember that for smooth manifolds embedded in Euclidean space, like when you have an embedding \\( M \\subset \\mathbb{R}^m \\), the induced Hausdorff measure coincides",

Hmm, interesting.\n\nFirst off, let me make sure I understand what \"full column-rank\" means. In linear algebra terms, a matrix has full column-rank if its rank is equal to the number of columns. Since our matrix is square (n x n), this means that the rank is exactly n. So, this implies that the columns are linearly independent.
